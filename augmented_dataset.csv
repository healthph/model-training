13474,X,"ive been travelling in ph for about 2 weeks now. ive been to many places in se asia but ph is by far the loudest place that i ever remember going. every place ive been to is just so extremely noisy. it is impossible to sleep after 6.30am because there will be always someone or something waking you up. i was on palawan for a week. spent a few days on the edge of a small village where i would be woken up around or before 6am by a cacophony of roosters, pigs, dogs, and a hammering neighbor who also loved to play loud music from 6am. sleeping before 1am was impossible because the nearby bar would blast music until at least that time. i hoped to find more peace in the more touristic and developed el nido, indeed there didnt seem to be many animals or hammering neighbors around my hotel, but filipino hotel guests who were talking and laughing and sometimes screaming loudly at breakfast at 7am more or less in front of my door. later they were replaced with other filipino guests who didnt speak much but instead played music during breakfast. currently im on bohol in a hotel where somebody is hammering the entire evening and morning from 6.30am. luckily they stop hammering for about 7 hours during the night. this morning it woke me up. my room is adiacent to the common area, where some filipino guests seem to be hanging out almost 247, talking loudly, making constant phone calls on speaker with their family and coughing as if they have long cancer. in fact, coughing and burping loudly seems to be another hobby of filipinos since the guests at the breakfast in el nido loved doing that as well. the male guest there had to burp loudly about every 20 seconds from 7 to 8 am. if that didnt disturb me enough, my current hotel faces the road where insanely loud motorbikes, buses and tricycles blaze past, constantly honking for god who knows what reason. what am i supposed to do here? and yes, i wear earplugs, even sometimes when im not sleeping, but the noise is just driving me absolutely crazy. how filipinos are able to live in their own country, i really dont know. its good that i have less than a week left here, or i would go permanently insane."

13476,"AURI, COVID","i just want to rant about how one person in the family recklessly caused everyone else in the household to be sick. it all started last week when my dad experienced symptoms. as early as then, my mom would tell him to wear a mask around the house, especially considering that we also have a senior living with us. but he didnt listen. he would react as if my mom was treating him harshly for being sick and respond with hindi na nga ako lumalapit masyado sainyo. he never attempted to wear a mask nor practice precautionary measures. he wouldnt cover his mouth when coughing or sneezingeven during meals, considering that he sits at the end of the table kabisera, in front all of us. he is disgusting. now, everyone in the household is sick, including my lola, and i hate it. it is very hard to function when sick. i am currently in my final year of college thats why im busy working on my thesis, alongside my other academics, and reviewing for the nmat. but i cannot work at my highest capacity because my current health condition doesnt permit me to. the same goes for my brother whos reviewing for his boards. it is frustrating and infruriating. all of these could have been prevented if my father wasnt only thinking of himself. yesterday he even went out and and ate at a boodle fight. how selfish and stupid, right? i am honestly livid with him. if it were us who got sick first, he definitely would have scolded us. i dont know why also, as youre probably wondering why he would scold us for being sick. thats just how his mind works. he would get annoyed, sometimes even mad, whenever he would hear repeated coughing. thats why i usually hold my cough at home whenever im sick. but, lo and behold, hes been receiving all the special treatment now that hes sick. if he wasnt the head of the household, i would treat him the same way he treats us. i would make him feel like it is his fault for being sick. not to mention, my father is one of those people who do not believed in covid. since 2020, we never attempted to get tested for covid despite experiencing symptoms every now and then. he thinks its just the regular flu. oh, and he also thinks that hospitals are crime syndicates. hes convinced that doctors purposely diagnose patients as covid positive to earn moneythat those who believe otherwise have been manipulated. hes also a bbm. lol."

13488,COVID,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasnt gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility 15 min drive from our barangay april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at naglbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pangamoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 34 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i cant really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell?room?. the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mildasymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didnt make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that."

13493,X,"i work for a corrupt office. heres what they do. tldr my bosses in a certain government agency are literally pocketing and misusing public funds. edit im adding more items below. sa sobrang dami ng ginagawa nilang corrupt practices di ko na malista lahat ng minsanan. please bear with me. please feel free to f5 this post as this is a developing story. news yarn? hindi talaga mawawala ang kurapsyon sa gobyerno.normal naman talaga na corrupt pag sa government office. these are some of the things ive been hearing about the government since waaaay back as a kid. high school pa lang yata ako ganito na naririnig ko. now that ive graduated from college, 100 adulting, and working in the government, i realized that this corrupt culture is more destructive than it sounds. theft is a criminal offense. but these bastards get away with it because theyre in the first three level of management, and because they can. the worst part of this all is that kami na mga tao ang pinapagawa nila nung dirty work. i work in a national government agency. i hate the inefficiency. i hate the system. i hate the bureaucracy. pero tinitiis ko arawaraw because were in the middle of a pandemic, im lucky to even have a job. tumataas gasolina, mga bilihin, at cost of living. i should be grateful to have a job at this kind of economy that were in. but every time i learn more about the corrupt practices, bumabagsak ang kumpiyansa ko sa sarili ko. sometimes, i get so sick in the morning before going to work, and getting into the bus and jeep to the office makes me cry with a lump in my throat. corrupt ang government. thats a given. but the stench is even worse pag andoon ka na sa loob. hindi ko alam kung paano sinisikmura ng mga taong nasa posisyon, including my bosses, yung mga ginagawa nila arawaraw na pangungurakot sa opisina. im going to try my best to list it down here, because i am so overwhelmed that i dont even know where to start. 1. they fake disbursement vouchers. government offices have quarterly targets. it differs from office to office, depende kung ano ang mandate ng agency. for example, kung may department of pencils, at ang trabaho nito ay ang magpamigay ng pencil sa mga bata, its possible target is distribute 1,000 pencils to school aged children in batangas city for the first quarter. the department of budget and management allots a budget to all government offices depending on these targets. yung budget ng cy 2022 ay hinihearing na as early as 2021. in our office, we are encouraged to fully disburse the national budget allotted to us dahil kapag may naiwan or narevert ka na funds sa end of the year, its grounds for reducing your offices budget for the next calendar year. however, instead of encouraging people to do their work para hindi masayang yung taxpayer money, my office produces fake disbursement vouchers para lang magastos yung pondo at hindi marevert. palalabasin nila na may ginawa silang activity, e.g., distribution of pencils in brgy. abc in batangas city, and naglalabas ang office ng aktwal na pondo para dito kahit na hindi naman ito isinagawa. since wala naman talagang naganap na activity, the money na dapat sana ay ginamit para sa ikabubuti ng school aged children who are in need of pencils is pocketed. 2. they get more funds than needed to pay for their junkets. faking disbursement vouchers is also done to fund the junkets of government officials. during the pandemic, it was proven several times that meeting virtually is just as effective as meeting personally to get things done or to cascade directives from ncr main offices to branchfield offices. now that halos alert level 1 na ang buong bansa, government officials are conducting face to face meetings in highend hotels in tourist hotspots in the country. yung mga bagay na pwede naman na gawin virtually, ginagawa nila in these expensive places and make it appear as if the public is benefitting from these management meetings. remember that their food, travel expenses, and accommodation are being paid for by public funds. these government officials dont use their own money to attend these extravagant meetings. para hindi ito masilip ng ating kaibigan na si commission on audit, ang ginagawa nila ay gagawa ng fake disbursement vouchers several, because usually one dv is not enough to pay for the junket, palalabasin na may ginawa na activity for juan dela cruz, when actually they just used the funds to pay for the very important management meeting. 3. falsification of documents. producing disbursement vouchers arent easy. marami itong attachment, including documentation and report, trip tickets, attendance sheets. when one fake dv is created, hindi lang iisang tao ang gumagawa nito, dahil each attachment needs signatories from bosses, employees, and other people. many times, ive seen people falsify documents para lang macomplete ang attachments at makakuha ng muchneeded funds. alam ito ng admin and accounting section but pumipirma naman sila at binibigay pondo. in other words, this falsification is a systemic, and its sickening. 4. favoritism. some employees, even though they are clearly incompetent at pumapasok lang para magpalamig sa office at magscroll sa fb maghapon, ay nilalagay sa mga matataas na posisyon dahil favorite sila ng mga boss. the worst part is that yung mga trabaho na dapat nilang gawin ay tinatambak sa amin na mga bata dahil walang alam gawin yung mga nilagay nila sa posisyon. may isa akong kaopisina na ang tanging trabaho niya ay gumawa ng fake dvs. yung isa naman ay ingatyaman ng mga naiipon na pera na nakukuha mula sa fake dvs. minsan naoverhear ko si boss na humihingi ng lima lima five p5k sa kanila kasi ipambibili niya raw ng isusuot niya para sa pupuntahan na birthday party sa weekend. ano kaya nilalagay nila sa resume nila? chief embezzler to the director? 5. fake biddings. every government agency has a bidding and awards committee bac who facilitate and oversee the procurement of goods, services, etc. for the government. kailangan ng paper ng office? bid. kailangan ng printer? bid. kailangan ng catering service? bid. sa office namin, mayroon nang friends ng boss or exemployees na nakatakda nang manalo sa bidding everytime. mayroon nang friends na palaging nanalo kapag kailangan ng office namin ng catering service, venue for junkets este meetings, and the like. and the other bidders? minsan fictional companies sila or sometimes real companies whose signatures are falsified. 6. christmas parties. i dont mean to be a scrooge, but ever since nagstart ako magwork sa government office, ive grown to hate christmas season. its the time that the office is the most corrupt. as mentioned in item 1, kailangang maubos ng isang government agency ang budget na inallot sa kanila ng dbm for the calendar year. since novemberdecember are the last months of the year, usually dito nakikita na marami pa palang pondo na hindi nagagastos ang office. kabikabilaang unneccessary meeting ang ginagawa sa mga buwan na ito, meetings na ang sole purpose ay ubusin ang pondo para lang walang marevert. and yes, youve guessed it! even our christmas parties are funded by taxpayer money. to fund this, they will produce a fake dv for yearend assessment or yearend target setting meeting and other similarsounding activities, but theyre actually junkets and christmas parties. 7. kapit tuko sa plantilla. everyone wants to be a regular employee and receive full benefits, leave with pay, and other perks. sa amin, though, this is doing more bad than good. may ibang employees na sobrang incompetent pero regular that its actually costing the government money. there are people in their 60s na kapit tuko sa position for the sake na mahakot ang retirement benefits, but their work output and productivity is low, sometimes zero. yung mga trabaho na pwede naman matapos ng isang 8hour na araw, inaabot pa kami hanggang weekend and holidays because they work so inefficiently slow. di na lang sila magretire at ibigay yung position nila sa mga employees na mas deserve naman. 8. working overtime on holidays and weekends. hindi ko naiintindihan kung bakit yung mga boss ko ay ang hilighilig magpatrabaho sa amin ng weekend at holiday. akala yata nila nakakadagdag pogi points. madalas kaming papasukin ng weekend at holiday para tapusin ang mga trabaho na pwede naman tapusin sa 5 days na work week, pero dahil sa bureaucracy and inefficient employees, pinapapasok pa kami beyond that. millenials and gen z, i dont need to explain how this excessive working and frustration results to burnout. tapos ilalagay nila sa newsletter ng office na nagoovertime si boss director and dapat siyang tularan. ginawa pang pr trip yung overtime. 9. electioneering. tuwing flag ceremony sa monday, pinapaalala ng aming boss na iboto a certain person running for high office. i think its okay to support a political candidate but its not okay to abuse your authority to have your tao vote for your manok. this quarter, pinadalahan si boss ng said political candidate ng mga campaign materials at inutusan kaming lahat na ipamudmud ito sa barabarangay or else daw."
13494,X,"im filipino, born and raised here, and this country has screwed me and my family over time and time again. systematically, it is an incompetent, petty and corrupt country. if you go to europe for the first time like i did, and come back, your resentment and shame of the philippines triples. thats how it felt when i came home. imagine setting foot in a country that has sidewalks you can actually walk on, old classical european buildings older than the history of your country maintained pristine and perfect, infrastructure that works, public transportation that works... and then you come home and see sht on the street, countless poor living on the street, the crumbling buildings, the floods, the sewers coughing up more sht, the sidewalks that have more sht than actual sidewalks. when i came home, i was so embarrassed, i didnt want my european friends to come to the ph, i didnt want them to see this. i saw that good standards of living exists, its possible and somewhere else. i started to be more unkind to the philippines, and at the moment, poor and stuck here, hating my country whilst being here wasnt healthy. i decided to do a big hard think and i realized not all countries are created equal. i went to pretty europe, a part of europe that didnt suffer much war and was never really exposed to major conflicts. plus, the philippines, geographically is a much much much more difficult place to live in. europe has extreme winters sure, but bc of where we are in the world, we suffer more natural disasters, we have floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, tsunamis and the tropical weatherhumidity. if any of those nice western countries had just one of these things, their nice european buildings would crumble in a week. on top of all this we were colonized. our languages, cultures, identities robbed from us pretty europe has never experienced colonization the way we did, naturally they would have a stronger national identity, stronger social trust societies. i know how alot of filipinos here feel when they look at their country, i feel the same. but hating the philippines and constantly comparing it to western countries is not fair, its not fair to the ph and its not fair to filipinos. another thing a european friend pointed out is western culture is uniquely cruel to its elderly. in the west, they dont take care of their elders, they dump them in homes and let them rot, thats how their young people get ahead of us. they move on with their careers, move out, advance their own lives, bc culturally, they dont tie themselves down with the responsibility of caring for their elderly but we do. their prosperity is also at the cost of abandoning their most vulnerable. a part of the reason why people my age here are struggling despite having stable jobs is bc we care for our elderly, our families, we dont up and leave. whether that be good or bad, that aspect of filipino society and culture is kindness that prosperous western countries dont have. i think thats something to be proud of. am i dirt poor bc im taking care of my parents and siblings? yes. would i stop caring for them in the pursuit of advancing my career? no. i get you hate it here, i do too, but being here and being spiteful wont help you. comparing your country with another country that has a completely different historygeography wont help you. it is literally just harder here. systematically, are we capable of doing and being better? yes! but do we have merits as a country, a culture, and a people against circumstances beyond our control? also yes. i think the ph will get better over time, and maybe you will be able to leave in search of greener pastures in the mean time, while youre here, learn to be fair and to be kind to the philippines, it will make your stay easier."

13497,X,"so, my father suffered from stroke. he was discharged from the hospital last july 6. little do we know that in the semi private room my mom and dad stayed at there was an 80 year old patient who was positive from covid and died last july 15. luck was on my moms side that patient did not stay in that same room for more than half a day before they transferred into a more private room. not to the story itself. as my dad was discharged, we did not know we should be supposed to be in quarantine. there was contact tracing and we were just informed yesterday. so yes we cant buy food because of that. but ever since going out of the hospital, my father and mother never showed symptoms. my father has pneumonia so if he was affected by covid then he would cough relentlessly. nope. theres none. my father could not still stand up as it was a stroke related to his cerebellum thus affecting his balance. he can not walk nor stand up. so yesterday, the barangay called us through my moms phone. they rushed my mom that they needed to be tested for covid. guess what, it took them more than hour to arrive. even wasted our time. plus, when they arrived to the testing facility there were no people around. they kept on complaining that they have to lift my dad. gosh, he suffered from stroke so he cant even walk. its been nearing 14 days already. and they just called yesterday. what the hell is this. were poor. we couldnt buy food. we talked it out to the barangay. we specifically told them that canned goods, pork and instant noodles are not allowed to stroke patients as it triggers high blood. just a few more info. my dads uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and sodium are exceedingly high which triggered his stroke. were running low on his medicines and we cant even buy them because of this stupid system. were even running out of funds. so today we told the barangay through the phone that my dad is not allowed on those three. what groceries they gave? canned goods, coffee, energen and rice. coffee is also not allowed. were thankful for the rice though but we still have lots of rice here. what we need is real food for my dad, not a handful of preservatives. it will be our day 14 on july 20. so what kind of system is this?"
13498,X,"paywall so i am posting the entire article here link they relied on chinese vaccines. now theyre battling outbreaks. by suilee wee more than 90 countries are using covid shots from china. experts say recent infections in those places should serve as a cautionary tale in the global effort to fight the disease. mongolia promised its people a covidfree summer. bahrain said there would be a return to normal life. the tiny island nation of the seychelles aimed to jumpstart its economy. all three put their faith, at least in part, in easily accessible chinesemade vaccines which would allow them to roll out ambitious inoculation programs when much of the world was going without but instead of freedom from the coronavirus, all three countries are now battling a surge in infections china kicked off its vaccine diplomacy campaign last year by pledging to provide a shot that would be safe and effective at preventing severe cases of covid19. less certain at the time was how successful it and other vaccines would be at curbing transmission. now, examples from several countries suggest that the chinese vaccines may not be very effective at preventing the spread of the virus, particularly the new variants. the experiences of those countries lay bare a harsh reality facing a postpandemic world the degree of recovery may depend on which vaccines governments give to their people. in the seychelles, chile, bahrain and mongolia, 50 to 68 percent of the populations have been fully inoculated, outpacing the united states, according to our world in data, a data tracking project. all four ranked among the top 10 countries with the worst covid outbreaks as recently as last week, according to data from the new york times. and all four are mostly using shots made by two chinese vaccine makers, sinopharm and sinovac biotech. if the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern, said jin dongyan, a virologist at the university of hong kong. the chinese have a responsibility to remedy this. scientists dont know for certain why some countries with relatively high inoculation rates are suffering new outbreaks. variants, social controls that are eased too quickly and careless behavior after only the first of a twoshot regimen are possibilities. but the breakthrough infections could have lasting consequences. in the united states, about 45 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, mostly with doses made by pfizerbiontech and moderna cases have dropped 94 percent over six months. israel provided shots from pfizer and has the secondhighest vaccination rate in the world, after the seychelles. the number of new daily confirmed covid19 cases per million in israel is now around 4.95. in the seychelles, which relied mostly on sinopharm, that number is more than 716 cases per million. disparities such as these could create a world in which three types of countries emerge from the pandemic the wealthy nations that used their resources to secure pfizerbiontech and moderna shots, the poorer countries that are far away from immunizing a majority of citizens, and then those that are fully inoculated but only partly protected. china, as well as the more than 90 nations that have received the chinese shots, may end up in the third group, contending with rolling lockdowns, testing and limits on daytoday life for months or years to come. economies could remain held back. and as more citizens question the efficacy of chinese doses, persuading unvaccinated people to line up for shots may also become more difficult. one month after receiving his second dose of sinopharm otgonjargal baatar fell ill and tested positive for covid19. mr. otgonjargal, a 31yearold miner, spent nine days in a hospital in ulaanbaatar, the capital of mongolia. he said he was now questioning the usefulness of the shot. people were convinced that if we were vaccinated, the summer will be free of covid, he said. now it turns out that its not true. beijing saw its vaccine diplomacy as an opportunity to emerge from the pandemic as a more influential global power. chinas top leader, xi jinping, pledged to deliver a chinese shot that could be easily stored and transported to millions of people around the world. he called it a global public good. mongolia was a beneficiary jumping at the chance to score millions of sinopharm shots. the small country quickly rolled out an inoculation program and eased restrictions. it has now vaccinated 52 percent of its population. but on sunday, it recorded 2,400 new infections, a quadrupling from a month before. in a statement, chinas foreign ministry said it did not see a link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines. it cited the world health organization as saying that vaccination rates in certain countries had not reached sufficient levels to prevent outbreaks, and that countries needed to continue to maintain controls. relevant reports and data also show that many countries that use chinesemade vaccines have expressed that they are safe and reliable, and have played a good role in their epidemic prevention efforts, the ministry said. china has also emphasized that its vaccines target severe disease rather than transmission. no vaccine fully prevents transmission, and people can still fall ill after being inoculated, but the relatively low efficacy rates of chinese shots have been identified as a possible cause of the recent outbreaks. the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of more than 90 percent. a variety of other vaccines including astrazeneca and johnson johnson have efficacy rates of around 70 percent. the sinopharm vaccine developed with the beijing institute of biological products has an efficacy rate of 78.1 percent the sinovac vaccine has an efficacy rate of 51 percent. the chinese companies have not released much clinical data to show how their vaccines work at preventing transmission. on monday, shao yiming, an epidemiologist with the chinese center for disease control and prevention, said china needed to fully vaccinate 80 to 85 percent of its population to achieve herd immunity, revising a previous official estimate of 70 percent. data on breakthrough infections has not been made available, either, though a sinovac study out of chile showed that the vaccine was less effective than those from pfizerbiontech and moderna at preventing infection among vaccinated individuals. a representative from sinopharm hung up the phone when reached for comment. sinovac did not respond to a request for comment. william schaffner, medical director of the national foundation for infectious diseases at vanderbilt university, said the efficacy rates of chinese shots could be low enough to sustain some transmission, as well as create illness of a substantial amount in the highly vaccinated population, even though it keeps people largely out of the hospital. despite the spike in cases, officials in both the seychelles and mongolia have defended sinopharm, saying it is effective in preventing severe cases of the disease. batbayar ochirbat, head researcher of the scientific advisory group for emergencies at mongolias ministry of health, said mongolia had made the right decision to go with the chinesemade shot, in part because it had helped keep the mortality rate low in the country. data from mongolia showed that the sinopharm vaccine was actually more protective than the doses developed by astrazeneca and sputnik, a russian vaccine, according to the health ministry. the reason for the surge in mongolia, mr. batbayar said, is that the country reopened too quickly, and many people believed they were protected after only one dose. i think you could say mongolians celebrated too early, he said. my advice is the celebrations should start after the full vaccinations, so this is the lesson learned. there was too much confidence. some health officials and scientists are less confident. nikolai petrovsky, a professor at the college of medicine and public health at flinders university in australia, said that with all of the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume the sinopharm vaccine had minimal effect on curbing transmission. a major risk with the chinese inoculation is that vaccinated people may have few or no symptoms and still spread the virus to others, he said. i think that this complexity has been lost on most decision makers around the world. in indonesia, where a new variant is spreading, more than 350 doctors and health care workers recently came down with covid19 despite being fully vaccinated with sinovac according to the risk mitigation team of the indonesian medical association. across the country, 61 doctors died between february and june 7. ten of them had taken the chinesemade vaccine, the association said. the numbers were enough to make kenneth mak, singapores director of medical services, question the use of sinovac its not a problem associated with pfizer, mr. mak said at a news conference on friday. this is actually a problem associated with the sinovac vaccine. bahrain and the united arab emirates were the first two countries to approve the sinopharm shot, even before latestage clinical trial data was released. since then, there have been extensive reports of vaccinated people falling ill in both countries. in a statement, the bahraini governments media office said the kingdoms vaccine rollout had been efficient and successful to date. still, last month officials from bahrain and the united arab emirates announced that they would offer a third booster shot. the choices pfizer or more sinopharm. reporting was contributed by khaliun bayartsogt, andrea kannapell, ben hubbard, asmaa alomar and muktita

13499,COVID,"3 weeks ago my parents were positive for covid19. the reason why? my mom went to our relatives across town to take care of my lola who asked for her to stay the night. my mom said my tita there was coughing and had fever, she asked for her to get tested. the next day my mom went home, cooked for us and basically had direct contact with the whole fam. before going to bed my parents received a call that my tita was positive for the antigen test. we asked the lgu to mass test everyone in that household but they refused and only swabbed my tita because she only had the symptoms. it also took 5 days before they got the result. i isolated my mom for that 5 days hoping my tita was negative but sadly she wasnt. on that same day we found out she was positive we asked a private laboratory approved by the doh to swab us at home and also my relatives who were living with my tita. turns out 710 of my relatives living with my tita were positive including my pregnant cousin, my lola, my tita with autism and my 4 yr old nephew and 25 were positive in our home i was so devastated because my mom has asthma and hypertension while my dad has type 2 diabetes. thankfully my mom was asymptomatic and my dad only had mild symptoms. yes they took human grade ivermectin prescribed by a physician and it really helped. i was already drinking vitamins c, zinc and omega3 ever since pandemic started maybe thats why i had a strong immune system and didnt get the virus even though i had direct contact with my parents all throughout the quarantine. i had to check their vitals everyday. i am sharing my experience because the largest cases of transmission is through household transmission and still the govt keeps locking us up in our houses. the implementation of lockdowns, faceshields, transportation suspensions, curfews and restrictions in public places pushed the filipino people to remove every protective gears they have once they step inside the comfort of their homes because the outside implementations are too much to handle. not to mention no healthcare worker visited us for the whole quarantine. my parents could basically just walk out, i almost tied my father inside because he keeps setting up appointments and errands during quarantine and if i wasnt there he wouldve went out. on the 10th day of quarantine the brgy nurse contacted me and asked how we were and said that if we were feeling okay they will assign us as recovered on that same day. i asked the nurse if we will undergo swab test before we were assigned as recovered and they told me if asymptomatic na po hindi na sila isswab. i told them my mom was asymptomatic on the very first day of quarantine but still she tested positive. the nurse asked how my mom was swabbed if she was asymptomatic, i told them we hired a private lab to swab us at home since the lgu is not providing it to us. the swab costs 3,200 each for rtpcr testing. we got swabbed after two weeks of quarantine by the same private laboratory and now all of us are negative. imagine if we didnt have the money for swab tests, my relatives and parents would have been roaming free spreading covid just because the govt refused to swab them as they were asymptomatic. imagine if my parents didnt have access to human grade ivermectin or vitamins then my parents with comorbidities wouldve faced severe symptoms. am i the only one seeing something wrong with how the govt is handling this pandemic? its frustrating that you cant do anything about it, more people are suffering its been more than a year and its becoming a cycle. if anyone here is from the govt please implement mass testing more contact tracing and remove the freaggin face shields my eye glasses wont fit with it and bikers are getting in accidents because of it, just tell everyone to use medical grade face masks instead. please i dont want another year taken away from our lives."
13500,X,"tatay was a man of few words. he rarely show emotion, even to us family. but i love how he shows and make us feel loved by working tirelessly to provide for our daily needs, crafting diy projects from custom shelves, tv stands, cabinets, etc. every saturday night hell ask us to buy some snacks while he prepare our dvd player to watch a movie. he just wanted a simple life, he worked his ass off for us to finish college, and never asked something in return, he only wants us to have be content and happy with our lives. his love is always for us, albeit in silence. years after i had my first job, and starting to pay off our debts, im starting buy gifts for him at random occasions, buying groceries for the family, slowly trying to let him be at ease. but everything changed last year. december 2019, hes been mentioning his frequent headaches, thinking it could just be caused by his failing eyesight. he wants to get checked but only got one by january 2020, thats when we were referred to a neuro and then have an mri scan. he even refused at that point since he knew mri scan is not cheap, but later agreed upon knowing it is covered by the health card i got for him and nanay. few days after getting an mri scan, we returned to the neuro. that was the time the doctor told us the what they found in the scan, a 4.5cm x 4cm x 4cm tumor on the right side of his brain part of brain responsible for organizing thoughts, speech some motor functions. hearing the news, i can help but step a little back and hold my tears while the doctor explains everything, all the while i remember those occassions in the past few months when hes stutterring noticeably, his left eyesight getting poorer, his left limbs getting spasms, and a lot more. later on, the doctor mentioned it needs to be removed and have a biopsy. knowing tatay, i know hell refuse. and he did, citing that surgery could cost us more than half a million. he only asked to have a second opinion, but the doctor told us the same thing. hes adamant of what the 2 neurologist have told us. he said it could just be something else, perhaps a simple headache. and then the pandemic came and lock downs happened. in few weeks time, we noticed an abrupt change in tatays condition, stutters became more notiecable, hes losing balance, and hes losing weight. then asked around how to score an appointment to a doctor during lockdown, thats when we got referred to a neurosurgeon. upon sending mri scan we had 3 months prior, he immediately called us and explained everything, convinced tatay to take the surgery. but we were in the middle of pandemic that time, pgh cant take our case other regional hospitals too. we had no choice but to have a surgery in a private hospital, the third doctor that we had referred us to another neurosurgeon that specializes on brain tumors. it was late may, when tatay had his crainiotomy. tatay had a successful surgery, and from a 5cm tumor they were able to remove 5.5cmx7.9cmx6cm tumor, a biopsy was then ordered. tatay also had a great recovery, since he was awake during the whole surgery, the doctor told us that if all goes well he can be discharged in a week. in a week, i have to go to each and every doctor to ask for discount to their pf, had to pull some strings in the hospital and pull out loans without the knowledge of tatay, and also through the help of family and friends tatay got discharged. that same day he got discharged, i vividly remember i went out to get groceries and a cake for tatay, doctor called and told that biopsy results came. tumor was a malignant one, and told me to get back to him as soon as i can. i was lining up at the counter that time, my knees getting weak and cant even hold my tears back while in front of the cashier. going home, i dont even know how am i going to tell them. i have to keep it for a day and let my family enjoy tatays return from a successful surgery. a day later, and doctors secretary called reminding us of our appointment after two weeks. that reminded me that i need tell them the results of the biopsy, and i told them that same day. two weeks later, doctor explained everything in full details. the tumor that were removed was indeed a cancerous one, and not just cancerous, a rare type and an aggressive one. again, its me, nanay and tatay in the clinic, everyones silent. and tatay asked about survival rate and how long hes going to live. it. again silence. and doctor told him that he only has about a year to live, if lucky, a few more months up to two years. after that, he referred us to another doctor. now, a neurooncologist. it was a silent trip going home. we dont even know what to say. doctor reminded me to set an appointment right away since tatay might need to start therapies sooner. from tatays next doctor, she told us everything we need to know, what to expect and the finances needed, and again tatay asked the same thing survival rate and life expectancy, and she answered the same thing. from this point onward, we have to expect the worst. it was painful for me to keep reminding myself that tatay cpuld be gone in less than a year. tatay soon started his chemo and radiotherapy sessions. months later something hit tatay, he became covid positive. but his body took it well, hes asymptomatic. but still he pushed to be in quarantine that time, and only nanay can take care of him. after twsting negative, he then resumed his theraphy and finally finishing all his sessions. from here onwards, it was us now taking care of tatay, making sure he takes his medicine, eating well, and recording if we notice anything wrong. aside from the bimonthly checkups and getting sets of chemotherapy tablets, tatay mostly stayed at home. it was a rollercoaster ride, we had fo endure his mood swings, depressive states and his the emotional stress hes going through. it was painful for us to see him that way. tatay who i mostly see as a strongwilled person crying hes going to die soon. tatays emotion became erratic, sometimes you can just hear him play some games or watch videos in his phone, somethime youll hear him crying, or shouting. it was early this year that his health started gradually decline again. doctor ordered an mri again, aside from his monthly ones, then we found another mas in his brain its was at 7cm that time and knew its growing so fast since they didnt see 2 or 3 weeks prior. we were given an option to operate on it again or ultimately wait for the inevitable. going home, we had to ask tatay and he refused the operation, saying its useless if upon removing it will come back. we chose the latter. after that, tatays condition started fo rapidly decline. him standing from bed became a difficult task for him, to the point in last march that he became bed ridden. his eyesight getting poorer. his stutter became random words, and from random words to unintelligible murmurs, to nothing. he cannot speak anymore and the only way we devised to communicate is by asking yesno questions tatay only needs to squeeze our hands. this was the time it hit me. were slowly losing tatay. i would come to his room, and hold his hands. hes just squeezing my hands in some sort of intervals but i cant figure out what hes trying to say. i can only whisper some comforting words in his ears, thanking him for everything hes done for us, and if hes thinking of the debts he doesnt have to, i reassure him that i will take care of nanay and my siblings, there wont be a time that well be hungry. i have to hold back my tears everytime i came to his room and tell those things while holding his hands. i have to show im strong enough. but at night i cant help but cry to sleep thinking how can i handle everything, and only my girlfriend knows that i sometimes cry to sleep and that im starting to get depressed overthinking. i cant even show my weakness to my family. while the 1 year that doctor told us is coming, i cant help but accept that tatay is slowly dying, a slow and hopefully not a painful one. last month, with us in the room, and with tatays siblings who coincidentally decided to visit him that day, we lost him. memory is still vivid, of the time we noticed his hands losing it warmth, his deep breathing and coughing, and i have to call his doctor and at the same time an ambulance. but that time, i had an idea that were losing him, from the endoflife care pointers that his doctor have told me, those last few hours, i only asked the doctor through call if this is it, she only told us the bring him to the hospital. but on transit, we lost him. the wailing siren got drown out of the cries of nanay and my tita. outside of the er, he was pronounced dead. tatay left us. tatay is now at peace, no sickness, no pain. today, fathers day, and also the 40th day of his death. i wish i can greet him and hug him, but that cant. and i hope i know what hes trying to tell me that time im holding his hand but he cant utter any word. to tatay, who gave everything for us, whos love will always be for us. i will always dedicate this day for you and celebrate the life we had when were together. and if youre still reading, this is the sign, call your dad. if you still had the chance to do so, cook something for him, ask him to teach you how fix a car, how to fix plumbing, anything that that youll enjoy doing together, and lastly thank him for all the things he has done."
13501,X,"from dr. edsel salvana understanding testing for covid19 and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isnt as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rtpcr. rtpcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rtpcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rtpcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a probable case even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture fever, cough, pneumonia is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratorybased elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure in contrast with clinical testing, it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible? it really depends on how you define it. if you define mass testing as populationbased testing, meaning testing everyone regardless of symptoms and exposure in order to pick out those infected, then it is not feasible and not useful. a. there is no point in testing someone who is not exposed and has no risk. it is just a waste of money and may come back as a false positive. b. even if you test everyone and they are negative, it doesnt mean they will no longer be exposed to the virus the next day and become a carrier and a case afterwards. c. even rtpcr will fail to detect virus within the first three days of the incubation period and you will miss a lot of asymptomatic someone without symptoms carriers. d. antibody testing for asymptomatic carriers is even worse than rtpcr they will not be positive because asymptomatic carriers havent produced enough antibodies to make the test positive. antibody tests become positive about 7 days after the symptoms show up and are best done after 14 days of symptoms because antibody levels are low until someone is on the way to recovery. e. testing everyone to determine the percentage of the population exposed is epidemiologic testing and can be done with a representative sample. it is a waste of money to test more than you need. a proper sample for communitybased testing of the entire philippines has been calculated to be as small 4,000 to 5,000 people. this is a far cry from doing 109,000,000 tests which is not necessary or advisable. if by mass testing we mean testing everyone who is at risk, then the government is already trying to do it and is paying for it. this is called enhanced targeted massive testing. a. this approach is the same approach that south korea and germany took. it is the same approach to which all the countries aspire. if you look at the world map in the first picture below, we are testing all patients with symptoms, which is a liberal approach compared with most countries in the world. in fact some lgus have been testing asymptomatics with exposure using rtpcr. b. not a single country has used rapid antibody tests for determining clinical disease in patients. only rtpcr is reliable enough to do this. the mass testing approach of south korea and singapore used rtpcrs, and only in those at risk. none of them used antibody tests to detect clinical disease. c. the who recommends against using rapid antibody tests for clinical decisionmaking. it can be used for research and epidemiologic testing, but not to decide who is sick or not. this may change as we get better tests, but for now it is too risky and maybe even deadly to base policy on unreliable tests. 3. are we doing enough testing? isnt more better? the who has pegged adequate testing as performing at least 10 tests for every one test that comes back positive. testing capacity has improved by leaps and bounds along with increasing healthcare facilities. currently we are doing about 16.3 tests for every 1 positive that comes back. that is better than the usa which is at 7.8 and nearly the same as germany which is at 18.6 2nd picture below. as a third world country, we need to conserve our resources. doing too much testing will divert limited money that we can use for our social amelioration programs and economic stimulus packages. there is a global shortage of materials, and if we use up what we have too early, we wont have any more materials to continue keeping track of the pandemic. this isnt going to end anytime soon. we need to be efficient with testing and not overdo it to the detriment of our resources and future capacity. 4. what is the best test to clear people for work? the best test to clear people for work is to check them for symptoms. symptomatic covid19 is responsible for 85 of transmission. the doh and psmid have already released guidelines to this effect and it is clear no need to do laboratory testing to clear people for work. but what about the asymptomatic carriers? there is no good test to completely eliminate asymptomatic transmission. this is why we need to covidproof the workplace with daily symptom checks, wearing of masks for everyone, physical distancing, handwashing and disinfection. neither rtpcr nor antibody testing will pick up all your asymptomatics. 5. why do some private companies want to test their employees? and why wont government pay for it? in my discussions with many private companies, a lot of them really want to do something to reassure their workforce that there is no covid19 around. even if scientists tell them that rapid antibody tests are not good enough to rule out asymptomatic spread and even rtpcrs can miss asymptomatic carriers, we realize that this may have a positive impact on the wellbeing of employers and employees. these companies say they are aware that the tests are imperfect, but they wish to proceed as they think this has some use either from an epidemiologic perspective, or to boost workplace safety practices. doh and psmid recommendations are that this kind of testing is unnecessary and not cost effective. but since this is a free country, as long as you use a properly validated kit and the employees consent they shouldnt be coerced into testing, then that is their call. companies will have to pay for testing outside usual parameters because the government cannot pay for testing that is not costeffective or in line with current evidence. of course, if an employee develops symptoms, then rtpcr will be paid for by the government according to doh and philhealth guidelines. there is also a private initiative to do serosurveys. this is a welcome effort because the governments resources are being strained by many things. the private sector has been a major partner in the covid response and the country cannot thank them enough for continuing to pay workers salaries, giving tremendous ppe and laboratory material donations, and maintaining solidarity in tackling this problem. i hope this document clarifies things. we are all one big filipino family, and like all families we fight from time to time. i think in the end we all want to protect our loved ones from this virus, and the passion with which we are all trying to do the right thing sometimes lets us get carried away. we are only in the first round and the only way to win is to stick together and help each other out."
13502,X,"bankrupt by boo chanco can a countrys president bankrupt its central bank? ferdinand marcos did that in 1983, and today, generations of taxpayers not yet born during marcoss time are still paying for those bad loans the marcos regime took out and wasted. i remember those bad old days. i was with pnoc at that time and saudi aramco wouldnt load any crude oil to our very large crude carrier vlcc parked at their ras tanura port unless we paid in advance. we used to get 60 days of credit. i was privileged to join a mission to negotiate oil supplies around the same time. we used our company learjet because it would facilitate our movement from one oil producing country to another. besides, the aircraft was due for maintenance in germany and was flying in that direction. our pilots carried several duffel bags full of dollar bills to pay for refueling our aircraft and other needed services. our usual credit card was no longer honored. they were not taking chances with us. the whole world knew marcos drove the philippines to the rocks. there was not enough foreign exchange at the central bank to pay for imports, including essential medicines. those were the days after ninoy aquino was killed by the regime. the countrys political situation was volatile. business confidence was down. there was capital flight, further exacerbating our precarious foreign exchange situation. then prime minister cesar virata was worried enough to take former central bank governor jaime laya and cesar buenaventura, the private sector representative to the monetary board, to new york to talk to our bankers. little did they know that the situation was worse than they imagined. as soon as they sat down with the head of the lead bank managing our account, they were told that the philippine foreign exchange reserves were overstated by 600 million. we were caught with our pants down, buenaventura told me in an interview last saturday. the banker told them there was nothing to talk about until they got their financial statements in order. buenaventura said they knew they had problems, but they were shocked to hear how bad the countrys situation was. neither virata, who was also the finance secretary, nor laya who was cb governor, had any inkling. the first order of business was to avert a debt default. so they rushed back to manila to verify the information they were given. they got sgv to go through the numbers, and sure enough they were told the 600 million overstatement was true. the country was broke. it was caused by a combination of factors constituting a perfect storm. the marcos cronies couldnt pay pnb, dbp, gsis, giving rise to a crisis among the three gfis. also adversely affected were crony banks traders royal and ucpb. principal exports like sugar and copra were suffering price declines. in the meantime, prices for essential imports like oil were rising fast. capital flight worsened after the assasination of ninoy. in short, we had a forex crisis. it was also found that pnb branches moved money to branches in another time zone with the same going back before banking hours opened in the sending branch. it gave the impression we had more dollars than we really did. the economic managers had to face the reality of having no more dollars in the central bank to pay the banks or to pay for basic imported necessities like oil. virata knew they had no choice but to request for a debt payment moratorium for about 20 billion in outstanding debt to some 300 banks. but the banks did not even want to talk to a marcos government official. virata knew they needed a new cb governor with enough international gravitas. they turned to jobo fernandez. it took a while to convince the veteran banker to take the job. when he finally agreed, he sat down with virata and company to assess the situation. at the end of it, buenaventura said fernandez remarked gentlemen the way this looks it seems we are just shuffling deck chairs on board the titanic. the sudden collapse of confidence from international financial institutions made it difficult for the philippine government to get debt relief, much less to borrow. both were needed to cut the increasing budget deficit. the government had to impose import controls and implemented foreign exchange rationing. forex access was primarily for the purchase of crude oil and petroleum products. all others had to get their own forex from the black market. to make sure the central bank had enough forex to pay for crude oil, then trade and industry secretary roberto ongpin tapped the binondo central bank. ongpin met weekly with five or six of the top binondo blackmarket traders of forex and decreed that they supply so much forex weekly at a set price. the dollar bills were packed, flown by private plane to hong kong, and deposited presumably in the central bank account at pnb hong kong. that simulates forex coming into the system to at least cover oil purchases. the country was on a handtomouth existence for its forex requirements. the central bank also created a fund to guarantee payment of airline tickets at guaranteed rates. the airlines refused to accept the unstable peso for payment. to address the threat of runaway inflation, the central bank introduced the socalled jobo treasury bills, which paid interest rates as high as 38 percent, to mop up liquidity. however, this may have also contributed to the rise in the cost of goods. they also hoped the high interest rate of the jobo bills would attract foreign exchange. the economic mess got worse. stagflation set in and gdp contracted for successive years. as a result many businesses failed. the peso was devalued from p81 to p14 then to p20 from 1983 to 1985. a tough imf economic stabilization program induced severe recession. the marcos government had to cut overall government expenditures to reduce deficits. epilogue marcos bankrupted the central bank it had to be dissolved and replaced

13503,COVID,"the post in quotes below is from an edsel maurice salvana physician, scientist, activist, ted fellow according to his fb. also regards to todays statement by harry roque that i laughed at but actually may have more merit. spox has said that mass testing is the wrong term and that it should be expanded targeted testing. but they seem to be doing a poor job of communicating this apparently, we are already doing the mass testing people have been asking for and additional testing is optional for private companies. why the hell doesnt he just say that? anyway, thoughts? how legit is this? post is below. understanding testing for covid19 and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isnt as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rtpcr. rtpcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rtpcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rtpcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a probable case even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture fever, cough, pneumonia is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratorybased elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure in contrast with clinical testing, it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible? it really depends on how you define it. if you define mass testing as populationbased testing, meaning testing everyone regardless of symptoms and exposure in order to pick out those infected, then it is not feasible and not useful. a. there is no point in testing someone who is not exposed and has no risk. it is just a waste of money and may come back as a false positive. b. even if you test everyone and they are negative, it doesnt mean they will no longer be exposed to the virus the next day and become a carrier and a case afterwards. c. even rtpcr will fail to detect virus within the first three days of the incubation period and you will miss a lot of asymptomatic someone without symptoms carriers. d. antibody testing for asymptomatic carriers is even worse than rtpcr they will not be positive because asymptomatic carriers havent produced enough antibodies to make the test positive. antibody tests become positive about 7 days after the symptoms show up and are best done after 14 days of symptoms because antibody levels are low until someone is on the way to recovery. e. testing everyone to determine the percentage of the population exposed is epidemiologic testing and can be done with a representative sample. it is a waste of money to test more than you need. a proper sample for communitybased testing of the entire philippines has been calculated to be as small 4,000 to 5,000 people. this is a far cry from doing 109,000,000 tests which is not necessary or advisable. if by mass testing we mean testing everyone who is at risk, then the government is already doing it and paying for it. this is called enhanced targeted massive testing. a. this approach is the same approach that south korea and germany took. it is the same approach to which all the countries aspire. if you look at the world map in the first picture below, we are testing all patients with symptoms, which is a liberal approach compared with most countries in the world. in fact some lgus have been testing asymptomatics with exposure using rtpcr. b. not a single country has used rapid antibody tests for determining clinical disease in patients. only rtpcr is reliable enough to do this. the mass testing approach of south korea and singapore used rtpcrs, and only in those at risk. none of them used antibody tests to detect clinical disease. c. the who recommends against using rapid antibody tests for clinical decisionmaking. it can be used for research and epidemiologic testing, but not to decide who is sick or not. this may change as we get better tests, but for now it is too risky and maybe even deadly to base policy on unreliable tests. 3. are we doing enough testing? isnt more better? the who has pegged adequate testing as performing at least 10 tests for every one test that comes back positive. testing capacity has improved by leaps and bounds along with increasing healthcare facilities. currently we are doing about 16.3 tests for every 1 positive that comes back. that is better than the usa which is at 7.8 and nearly the same as germany which is at 18.6 2nd picture below. as a third world country, we need to conserve our resources. doing too much testing will divert limited money that we can use for our social amelioration programs and economic stimulus packages. there is a global shortage of materials, and if we use up what we have too early, we wont have any more materials to continue keeping track of the pandemic. this isnt going to end anytime soon. we need to be efficient with testing and not overdo it to the detriment of our resources and future capacity. 4. what is the best test to clear people for work? the best test to clear people for work is to check them for symptoms. symptomatic covid19 is responsible for 85 of transmission. the doh and psmid have already released guidelines to this effect and it is clear no need to do laboratory testing to clear people for work. but what about the asymptomatic carriers? there is no good test to completely eliminate asymptomatic transmission. this is why we need to covidproof the workplace with daily symptom checks, wearing of masks for everyone, physical distancing, handwashing and disinfection. neither rtpcr nor antibody testing will pick up all your asymptomatics. 5. why do some private companies want to test their employees? and why wont government pay for it? in my discussions with many private companies, a lot of them really want to do something to reassure their workforce that there is no covid19 around. even if scientists tell them that rapid antibody tests are not good enough to rule out asymptomatic spread and even rtpcrs can miss asymptomatic carriers, we realize that this may have a positive impact on the wellbeing of employers and employees. these companies say they are aware that the tests are imperfect, but they wish to proceed as they think this has some use either from an epidemiologic perspective, or to boost workplace safety practices. doh and psmid recommendations are that this kind of testing is unnecessary and not cost effective. but since this is a free country, as long as you use a properly validated kit and the employees consent they shouldnt be coerced into testing, then that is their call. companies will have to pay for testing outside usual parameters because the government cannot pay for testing that is not costeffective or in line with current evidence. of course, if an employee develops symptoms, then rtpcr will be paid for by the government according to doh and philhealth guidelines. there is also a private initiative to do serosurveys. this is a welcome effort because the governments resources are being strained by many things. the private sector has been a major partner in the covid response and the country cannot thank them enough for continuing to pay workers salaries, giving tremendous ppe and laboratory material donations, and maintaining solidarity in tackling this problem. i hope this document clarifies things. we are all one big filipino family, and like all families we fight from time to time. i think in the end we all want to protect our loved ones from this virus, and the passion with which we are all trying to do the right thing sometimes lets us get carried away. we are only in the first round and the only way to win is to stick together and help each other out."
13504,X,"root of all evil quiboloy churchs demands for money mire followers in debt dec 10, 2021 216 pm pht inday espinavarona, herbie gomez emil mercado pastor apollo quiboloys wealth is built on the heaving backs of his followers. the children of his kingdom are made to quit school or jobs, sell properties, and take out loans to meet quotas. they are punished when they fail to deliver, abandoned when they get sick. singaporebased worker reynita fernandez was only in grade 3 when she started immersion in the childrens department of pastor apollo quiboloys kingdom of jesus christ kojc. her mother, a devoted member of the church, said nothing when 14yearold reynita answered the call to be a fulltime worker. the teenager and three jeepney loads of minors took a land and ferry trip from davao city, quiboloys base, to quezon city, where they were packed like sardines in a rented house. they spent an entire month soliciting funds from strangers, using the cover of several foundations to meet quotas. the shy fernandez learned to hop aboard buses to preach and beg. she even ended up in a cockfighting ring, scrabbling at dirt to collect money thrown by gamblers. you really have this eagerness. we have to do this. i have to earn money. i have to go home with lots of money. i need to find some way, she told rappler. arlene caminong stone, now based in minnesota in the us, was fernandezs contemporary. she said they pretended to be orphans, sometimes deafmutes, determined to continue with schooling. the reality was the opposite. i was in my third year of high school when they told me that i had to stop going to school because december was coming up and december was a big moneymaking month, said stone. later, she was told to drop out of school. this was in 1991, stone remembered, and mount pinatubo in zambales had just erupted. apollo quiboloy made a claim that it was the ultimate sign of the second coming. thats why we have to leave our school, to leave our family. and join the ministry, she said. meanwhile, fernandez, stressed out by impossible demands, ran away from the kingdom in 1998. i didnt get out because i saw something wrong. i felt i wasnt worthy anymore. its because i couldnt cope with the goal and the quota and everything financial, she said. only then did fernandez realize how little she knew about the world after spending her formative years in a mental tunnel, where only orders mattered and church ministers viewed questions as the devils work. fernandez said escape was liberating. yet she kept the kojc faith, fearful of being cast into hell. she continued sending financial contributions for two decades. she tacked quiboloys face on her bedroom wall. the kojc welcomed her back into the fold in 2016, when she found work in singapore. then the old nightmare returned. she was ordered to lead one of several quiboloy fundraising groups in singapore. kojc members, cans in hand, roamed crowded bukit timah, harbourfront, holland village, bishan market, serangoon, tampines, and jurong point, asking passersby for donations from 8 am to 8 pm daily. a member had to fill three cans a day. the contents of each can ranged from sg300 about p11,000 today to sg400 about p14,700. she said kojc workers committed fraud fronting for kjc society in singapore. they applied for permits, but fudged reporting, declaring collections of only sg20 p735 today or less each can. fernandez recalled that one of the kojc groups remitted to the philippines as much as sg5,000 about p184,501 for a weeks collections. it tried to evade the attention of singapores strict fiscal authorities by splitting the money into small batches, not more than sg2,000 p73,800 each. honolulubased lawyer michael jay green, quiboloys chief legal counsel, called all the accusations a bunch of nonsense, even as he pinned all the blame on the former manager of the pastors aircraft fleet, a nepalese named shishir bhandari. green said bhandari, his filipino wife, and inlaws exmembers of kojc who held key positions in the church were behind quiboloys indictment, and they supposedly reached out to former members around the world to get them to say nasty things about the preacher. he alleged that everything was orchestrated by bhandari, his wife, and extended family after they supposedly flew out of the philippines when they learned that they were being audited by kojc. green alleged that bhandari then made a deal with the federal bureau of investigation fbi in an attempt to bring quiboloy and his church down. beasts of burden the appointed son of god, as quiboloy calls himself, was not content with tithes representing a tenth of the members income, the former members said. usbased former follower faith killion told rappler that every sunday service included calls for love offerings even bigger than the tithes. in singapore, fernandez gave sg200 p7,380 every month. like everyone else, she had to scramble to meet quotas for quiboloys april 25th birthday and the month of blessing mob also called the month of sacrifice. it typically coincided with the christmas season as fundraising usually began in the month of september. killion said there were offerings for the ministry for the poor, the television ministry, for the kojcs publications, for concerts, for a stadium project in davao city, and an emergency fund. there were also wave offerings cash in envelopes that members handed over as they danced to chirpy choir songs after the sermons. fernandezs group was directed to raise sg12,000 about p442,800 for the mob. she had to deliver sg500 about p18,450 for quiboloys birthday her group also had to turn over sg2,500 about p92,250 for the same event. those birthday gifts, and proceeds from the tribute to the king midyear sacrifice, bought new homes and cars for the appointed son of god. in the us, quotas for the mob ranged from us10,000 over p503,000 to us50,000 over p2.52 million, depending on ones financial status and ability to raise money, killion said. quiboloys wealth was built on the heaving backs of his followers. the children of the kojc labored like mules. unmet quotas were considered debts. they also led to harangues about ones cursed soul. killion said members of her batch in manila woke up at 3 or 4 am for prayers. by 6 am, they were at their work areas. we were not allowed to go home. it didnt matter if its past midnight, until we met our individual quotas, she said. fernandez and stone served together in the 1990s. stone said they dragged heavy loads of rice cakes in kidapawan and general santos, returning to davao only to shower and repack, snatching sleep on their jeepney shuttles. when an ailing fernandez appealed for a reprieve in singapore, she was brushed off. fernandez said she had to lose her house in the philippines, and hit a low of having no daily fare money, before she finally broke free. in hongkong, exkingdom member fatima and her group were once ordered to raise hk300,000 over p1.9 million for an mob. when they failed to hit the target, they were berated as dumb and lazy, and told to make up for the shortfall the following year. the mob exacted grim attrition on members. students dropped out of school, employed members could find themselves jobless at the close of season. even the most loyal of followers get dumped when age and illness take their toll. killion left the kojc after 25 years of service, but her mother, a real estate broker who excelled in closing deals, stayed on as a fulltime worker until she suffered a recent bout of illness. all that she earned went to quiboloys group. before she got sick, she remitted p380,000 to the kingdom, killion said. but when her mother suffered a stroke while working for the kojc, the devoted believer was left to shoulder her hospitalization and other medical costs. without her daughter, she would have died of hunger. groomed for exploitation quiboloy and his lieutenants allegedly groomed those targeted for exploitation, whether in davao, in the us, or in asian countries. stone, a former pastoral, survived beatings and domestic servitude to quiboloy in davao city. she left her pastoral duties and migrated to the us in 2004. pastorals refer to privileged and attractive women who perform special tasks and do numerous errands for quiboloy as supposed forms of service to god. a year after, a visiting quiboloy was showering stone with attention, including exclusive lunches. she was also exempted from the costs charged to lapsed members returning to the ministry, which killion placed at p50,000 roughly 1,000. the church had done its homework. stone had by then married a pilot, who more than adequately provided for the family. she could afford to send her own income exclusively to the church. she sheltered and fed kojc workers, rented cars for them, and even paid us18,000 over p906,000 in accident damage costs as her share of the kingdoms work. but quiboloy wanted more from stone the services of her pilot husband and a return to davao city, where he promised free housing and education for her children. stone and her now exhusband turned down the offer. after they divorced, she also turned down a request to marry a minister. then her mother got sick. stone asked to be spared contributions but ministers told her the ailment was punishment for defying quiboloys wishes. thats why i was cursed, thats why my mom had to pay for it, stone recalled them telling her. only then did she sever all ties to the church. fatima was also pampered, and was thus induced to begin using her funds to purchase food that she cooked and sold, turning over to the kingdom all proceeds and even capital. one sunday, she spent hk1,000 over p6,400. she took out a hk30,000 loan over p193,000 for the church. even her passport was pawned to raise funds for the kojc. but when church leaders told her to lie and borrow hk10,000 over p64,500 from her employer, fatima erupted and called it quits. bogus charity work like fernandez, killion grew up in the church, soaking in the sermons of quiboloy, courtesy of her mother, a dedicated follower. at the age of 12, killion was out on the streets, soliciting. she later worked, parttime, for the churchs trimedia department, doing voiceovers and transcribing the preachers sermons. from that vantage point, she listed down through the years the many philippine groups the solicitors represented the childrens joy foundation incorporated handog ng pagmamahal association incorporated psalm of david harmonic orchestra incorporated the sheavers association alay sa may mga kapansanan association incorporated pagdamay sa dukha association incorporated pagasa ng buhay association incorporated pagasa ng buhay foundation incorporated life giver association incorporated sonshine philippines movement indigenous peoples innovation and yields for assured lives foundation incorporated ipiyal the keepers club incorporated batang kaharian kingdom children growth school kcgs as of december 10, kcgs has no record of registration with the securities and exchange commission sec. batang kaharian is a tv show produced by quiboloy churchs sonshine media network international smni under swara sug media corporation. the highprofile cfji has a main shelter for orphans and abandoned children in the churchs davao compound. occasionally, it organized childrens parties in davao, africa, and even in the us. in 2019, social welfare secretary rolando bautista gave the foundation the top award for nongovernmental organizations during the department of social welfare and developments panata awards. killion and the women who bolted from kojc, however, claimed childrens parties only happened once in a blue moon, usually coinciding with quiboloys birthday or other big kojc events when they would invite guests. the children in the davao facility were actually children of kojc workers, they added. these former believers want the government to probe into cfjis operations, as us prosecutors have called it a bogus charity organization used as a front for alleged money laundering and sex trafficking operations. dark side of faith even as kojc members raised funds for the church, they were also the captive market for quiboloy relics photographs, pieces of colorcoded cloth soaked in oil, scented oil, handkerchiefs with embroideries of the preachers name, and prayer booklets. much like how the catholic church sells objects to help believers with their every need, the kojc marketed the quiboloy items as having supernatural powers for healing, protection, and prosperity. sociologist and ateneo de manila religion professor jayeel cornelio said quiboloys narrative of his latest dream has god declaring, apollo, your name is my name and my name is your name. thats a jump to godlike status, no longer just the anointed but the divine anointing power. that, and his claim of being persecuted, can only increase pressure on kojc members to meet even the most unreasonable demands. the fear is mixed with the smugness of exceptionalism. identity generates pride. the stronger that is, the greater the anxiety over banishment. the stricter the church is, according to cornelio, the stronger it is from a sociological perspective. members face tough tests for acceptance. and leaving is much harder. rappler.com"
13505,X,"million dollar question are those in power forcing an end to a pandemic far from over? is your democracy not working for you? i post my thoughts online so that 1, 5, 10, 20 years from now, i would be able to have a recollection of events on what happened and how government has failed to do its duty to protect its citizens. dr peter cayton, a statistician who is part of the up covid response team tweets on the 16th of may. ncr rt is at 1.1971 up from 1.1627, with 95 credible interval at 1.1262, 1.2703. there is sufficient evidence of increase transmission of covid19 in metro manila. what does that 0.03 or 1 mean? read until the end to find out how significant that 1 is. how do pandemics end in the first place? looking at historian records, there are two endings. medically when death rates and infection rates plummet down and socially when the fear of the disease fades. 1 an end doesnt always happen when a disease has been eradicated but people have grown tired of fear. which history has also documented to be really messy. an example is the case of the bubonic plague in the 1800s where people drank heavily, went merrymaking and dismissing the whole thing as an enormous joke which killed 12 million people in india alone. on may 16, the government decided that parts of the country 810 provinces would be allowed to transition to open more parts of their economy. this included shopping malls where mostly all forms of public transport go to. the governor of cavite was quick to react when on day 1, social distancing requirements were violated. 23 on may 18, after nearly two months and two weeks of lockdowns, the government blatantly says that the government has no program yet for mass testing, saying that authorities will leave such efforts in the hands of private businesses. after nearly 75 days of sacrifice for everyone, an open admission to a lack of postecqmecqgcq surfaces. 4 does this government even know what happens when you pass on a 1,5003,000 average test cost fee to the private sector? they just pass it down to the end consumers! operating expense budgets are increase so as to the fees collected. for example, you ask a mall owner to test their employees, all 1,000 of them, that 2,250person or 2.2m fee per test is passed on to the businesses who rent. if the lgu asks tests to be done twice a month, the fee balloons up to 4.4m. it doesnt stop there! the things that are sold in malls lipsticks, food, essential items. every. single. cost. increases. when you ask businesses to decide, procurement teams would naturally go for the cheapest options. its their kpi di ba, to save the company money? would they know between the difference of rtpcr tests, rapid antibody tests or serology tests. sympre hindi. who would expect them to know right? on march 25, the ra 11469 or the law that guides effort to combat the disease was passed. approx. 3,000 per filipino 308b budget 106m population was allotted. while this isnt enough to cover costs for testing everyone, a lockdown wouldve been the answer to separating those who should and shouldve not been tested. on april 2, my uncle, richard tiu, passed away due to complications from covid 19. his wife and kids, my aunt and cousins only found out after he passed away. 5 no requests from the hospital on who he may have encountered, no requests for contact tracing. everything was the effort of my cousins and aunt. nakakahiya, para saan pang mamamatay ang mga front liners kung basic establishment of transmission chain hindi ginagawa. it takes 3 negative results before patients are diagnosed covid free. on may 13, the funniest press briefing from the presidential spokesperson occurred. a bandera reporter asked for the secretarys reaction to an online publication saying the philippines ranks as one of the worst performing asean countries in combatting covid19 alongside with singapore and indonesia? the response of the good secretary? sec. roque well, isa lang po iyan siguro sa mga naglalabas ng ratings pero iyong naunang lumabas po is ang toluna study blackbox of singapore na nagpapakita na panganim daw tayo sa pinakamagaling na magresponde sa buong daigdig dito sa covid19. so, mas naniniwala po ako dito sa singaporean study na ito. and what was that study he was quoting? a measurement, take note, measurement, of sentiments of citizens from 23 countries toward their countrys pandemic crisis management efforts. indicators were national political leadership, corporate leadership, community and media. only one of the four aspects concern, the good secretary. it wasnt conclusive that it was because of the govts efforts kaya naging panganim tayo. and besides, paano tayo magiging pang anim. on the same conference, up experts have questioned the accuracy and integrity of doh data of covid cases. up experts said data being provided by doh has significant implications on the reliability of scientific analysis on covid19? ang sagot ni sec duque, at head ng iatf? napakaganda. to quote less than 1 ang dinidispute nila. what does that 1 mean? it varies from having the whole municipality of pateros disappear from doh data to having germanys health care systems overwhelmed in five months to three because of a 1 increase. when your government acts like a chapter from the choose your own adventure, we can all just be very anxious. come on, pilipinas. we can do better. dont just stay quiet about it! are you an employee? urge your company to adopt wfh measures. lets all be open to arrangements that weve never tried before. no playbook has prepared anyone for this, lets do everything to keep businesses afloat, jobs intact, people fed and lights on. dlsu came up with a good interim blueprint are you a student? help your parents write your school administrators to give better rates for ay 20202021 after all, everyones doing online learning, why will the fees be the same? urge everyone to sacrifice a little pay cut. it would mean a lot to them. if youre someone stuck in between and can afford to stay home, please do so. urge your govt representative congress and councilor to get your lgus to subsidize the testing. get them to release their own measures what they have done to help create a new normal. also, try to learn a new skill, read a book, practice yoga, take up an online job. just dont go out. it doesnt mean that malls are open is that everything is back to normal. take it from someone who has a store in a mall in quezon city. 1 2 3 4"
13506,X,"full article success of masagana 99 all in imees head up researchers miguel paolo p. reyes, joel ariate jr, larah vinda del mundo vera files may 24, 2020 215pm from the marcos revolution a progress report on the new society of the philippines manila national media production center, 1980. manila, philippines the recent exchange between sen. imee marcos and finance secretary carlos dominguez iii over masagana 99 reminded us of the late presidents claim of success of his banner program to achieve rice selfsufficiency. masagana 99 aimed to increase rice production among filipino farmers. the program that began in 1973 derived its title from the term masagana which means bountiful and 99, referring to the number of sacks cavans of rice yielded per hectare of land in every harvest season. yes, the philippines exported rice under masagana 99 but... during the may 20 senate hearing on the governments response to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic, dominguez cut short marcos, chair of the senate committee on economic affairs, when she started batting for the adoption of a masagana 99 m99 scheme in helping raise farmers production. i was the secretary of agriculture that cleaned up the mess of masagana 99 that was left by masagana 99. there were about 800 rural banks that were bankrupted by that program and we had to rescue them. so whether it was a total success or not has to be measured against that, dominguez said. marcos was caught off guard by the remark. she tried to parry it by insisting that masagana 99 was a success since it allowed the country to export rice, a claim refuted by dominguez, saying ah, no. we never exported rice. we never exported rice, maam. on may 21, marcos issued a press release castigating dominguez shame on you, secretary dominguez, give the filipino farmer some credit! when supported by sound government policy and defended against rampant importation, we can feed ourselves. give the filipino farmer a chance! a thorough look at the muchhyped masagana 99 showed that for a brief time after it was launched, the philippines did become a riceexporting countrybarely. but data and studies show that this point of pride for the marcoses and their supporters was not solely attributable to the masagana 99 credit program. moreover, echoing dominguez, this success came at a significant cost, not only to the government, but also to the farmers that the program was supposed to help. masagana 99 also had an adverse impact on the environment brought about by its dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. masagana 99 after a series of natural disasters and pest infestations in 1972, the philippines faced a nationwide rice shortage. this prompted the government to intensify rice production with the masagana 99 rice program. launched on may 21, 1973, masagana 99 was a crash program primarily intended to raise the yield of palay crop lands per hectare to 99 cavans, from the then national average of 40 cavans per hectare. not only did it seek recovery from losses incurred from the previous years of low productivity, it also aimed to scale down importation and eventually achieve rice selfsufficiency in record time. at the core of masagana 99 was a package of technology offered to farmers in the form of highyielding variety hyv seeds, herbicides, lowcost fertilizer, and other modern agricultural inputs. the supervised credit scheme, on the other hand, was designed to make sure that the farmers can actually use the recommended technology package provided for by the program. the central bank extended subsidized rediscounting facilities to both public and private credit institutions to act as stimuli for banks to channel their loans to the agricultural sector. with reduced cost of borrowing made possible by highly subsidized interest rates, in theory, the farmers could avail themselves of the credit program even without collateral and other standard borrowing requirements. masagana 99 had peculiar beginnings. after several futile attempts to ramp up rice production in 19721973, a group composed of peter smith of shell chemical company, inocencio bolo of the up college of agriculture, and vernon eugene ross of international rice research institute irri presented a proposal to then secretary of agriculture arturo tanco jr. consisting of an integrated package of technology which, they claimed, could produce the coveted 99 cavans of rice per hectare, even on nonirrigated land. despite broad skepticism over the soundness of the technology which was drastically different from traditional methods and the feasibility of its widescale deployment, tanco went ahead with it as a lastditch effort. marcos immediately approved the proposal. the national management committee nmc consisting of various government and private agencies was created to implement the program, with the ministry of agriculture and the national food and agriculture council coordinating it. the nmc worked alongside technical and information committees, and working under them were coordinators ranging from the regional level down to the level of farmercooperators. provincial governors and municipal mayors were tasked to deliver the required number of beneficiaries from their areas. the crash program was initially envisioned to run only for a single planting season, from may to october 1973. it initially targeted to benefit 400,000 farmers from 43 selected provinces, and to cover about 600,000 hectares of land. marcos soon expanded its scope and targets and turned it into a highpriority national program that ran longer than expected, even by the project proponents. initial funding for the rice credit program came from the united states agency for international development usaid, which provided a p 77.5million loan. the world bank was also part of the financing scheme. as explained by mahar mangahas in a 1974 discussion paper the central bank passed the funds on initially through a loan to the governmentowned philippine national bank pnb and increased government deposits at the privatelyowned rural banks. it then provided extensive support through rediscounts of loan papers obtained by the pnb branch banks and the rural banks. funds flowed at a very fast rate indeed. the banks were apparently under strict orders to fulfill loan quotas and not to worry too much about collateral or documentary requirements. masagana 99 was launched in may 1973. by july 18 it was reported that p192 million had been lent three weeks later the figure had become p249 million. finally, by april 1974, p503 million was reported to have been lent, covering a total of 676,000 hectares, or an average of p745 per hectare. the targeted borrowers were farmers of small landholdings more or less two hectares, of which, according to estimates then, numbered around 1.4 million. less than half of this number would benefit from masagana 99. statistics collated by emmanuel esguerra in his 1981 paper on masagana 99 that came out in the philippine sociological review offers a clear picture on how the program played out from 1973 to 1980. during the very first phase of masagana 99 may to october 1973, 402,757 borrowers accounted for a loan total of p 369.5 million. the third phase of masagana 99 may to october 1974 had the most number of borrowers at 531,249 for a total loan of p716.1 million. this was not improved upon for the duration of the program. starting 1975 there was a marked decline in the number of farmers who availed of masagana 99 loans by then it was just a little over 100,000. in masagana 99s 14th phase november 1979 to april 1980, the number of borrowers sunk to 54,250. there was also a steady decline in the repayment rate. when masagana 99 started in 1973, 93.3of the loans were repaid. by 1979, the repayment rate fell to 45.8 what went wrong various sources have highlighted how masagana 99 was simply unsustainable. one key problem, as alluded to by dominguez, was rural bank insolvency, a consequence of nonpayment by farmerborrowers of their loans. according to a report of the world bank, dated may 12, 1983, titled philippines agricultural credit sector review the rice area financed by institutional credit decreased from 920,000 ha hectares in 197374 to 330,000 ha in 197980 or from 79 to about 18 of the total rice area in the respective years. the decline in institutional credit was the result of arrearages under past masagana99 and other supervised credit subloans which were due to several factors including natural calamities, inadequate postharvest storage facilities, marketing problems, unremunerative costprice relationships, the low priority given by farmers to repaying the governmentbacked loans, poor selection of credit risks and the provision of excessive loan amounts. the arrearages disqualified a large number of small farmers from receiving fresh credit and also disqualified many rural banks from receiving rediscounting support from the central bank. the accumulated nonrepayments under m99 amount to about p180 million in pnb and p300 million in rural banks. in short, farmerborrowers were defaulting not only because of production shortfalls caused by the various natural disasters affecting philippine agriculture in the 1970s and the 1980s, but also because the government was not prudently regulating the loans and providing sufficient mechanisms and inducements for repayment. m99 became, more or less, a massive doleout program. that many were defaulting on m99 loans was no secret. an article in the straits times in singapore, dated august 25, 1981, noted that masagana 99 and a similar program for fisherfolk, biyayang dagat, were both lacking in funds, with a philippine government official claiming that the repayment rate for masagana 99 loans was at 60. kenneth smith of the usaid, in his article titled palay, policy and public administration the masagana 99 program revisited, noted that even such repayment rates were distorted, given that whenever a loan was restructuredextended, for bookkeeping purposes. . .the outstanding loan was fully paid up and a new loan agreement was initiated. smith also noted that many uncollectable m99 loans were written off by lenders, further distorting the actual repayment rate. a 1978 study by v. cordova, p. masicat, and r.w. herdt for the irri found that availing loans from masagana 99 made no difference in the net returns of farmers. overall, according to the may 30, 1991 staff appraisal report of a world bankfunded philippine rural finance project, about 80 of the masagana99 loans have never been recovered. randolph barker of cornell university tried to give it a positive twist by saying that it became income transfer. what did all that money do? in his technical assessment of masagana 99, smith concluded that the program was indeed successful in attaining national selfsufficiency in rice production but the programs actual achievements were much more mundane than anticipated, and even this degree of success was more fortuitous than finessed. smith further noted that the programs achievements were due neither to the intensity of technical supervision nor the provision of noncollateral credit. instead, it could be attributed to the expansion of hectarage planted to rice, not increasing yields to 99 cavans per hectare using new technology. for emmanuel esguerra, masagana 99s importance during the marcos dictatorship was more political than economic. the mere existence of a credit program offering lowcost loans to farmers conveniently provides its sponsoring government the means of gaining political and ideological support by publicizing its concern for the rural poor, without necessarily altering the prevailing structure of asset ownership which is the main source of inequality. there was even a strain of counterinsurgency effort in masagana 99 as pointed out by mangahas. areas where there is subversion or dissidence are pointedly included, a policy which appears specific to the marcos regime, or the socalled new society, he noted. as it was also a political project, the corruption that it entailed was the cost of doing business for the marcos dictatorship. national scientist gelia castillo, in a chapter on masagana 99 in her book how participatory is participatory development?cited studies and news stories detailing how rural bank officials concocted fake farmers and ghost borrowers to siphon off millions of pesos intended for masagana 99. benedict kerkvliet, in a 1974 pacific affairs article, underscored that the banks remain in the hands of the local elites. the loss of public funds in masagana 99 grist the mill of marcoss political patronage. another poisoned legacy of masagana 99 that was often overlooked was its deleterious effect on the environment and on traditional agricultural methods. the heavy reliance on pesticides ironically led to pest outbreaks, the absence of one set of predators led to the prevalence of another. indigenous local flora and fauna were devastated by the use of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other chemical components of masagana 99s technological package. reliance on chemical input, in synthetic fertilizer in particular, puts into doubt the claim of masagana 99 rice selfsufficiency. the dollar supposedly saved from not importing rice just went out another door in importing fertilizer. again, despite all of the above, sen. marcos insists that masagana 99 should still be seen as a success because it led to philippine rice exportation. as detailed by eduardo tadem in grains and radicalism the political economy of the rice industry in the philippines, 19651985, between 1977 and 1983, some 502,000 metric tons of rice were exported by the philippines. however, citing a previous study by flordeliza lantican and laurian unnevehr, tadem gave the following breakdown of that amount, which shows that the volume of rice exported then was not consistent nor particularly high, save between 1979 to 1981 table 1 the country resumed rice importation in 1984, and ceased to export rice completely in 1985. according to tadem, by july 1984, the reserve stocks of the country was down to 150,000 tonssufficient for only 10 days. thus, the country contracted to import rice from thailand and china and, later in the year, from indonesia, which had previously imported rice from the philippines. in 1985, the philippines imported a total of 389,654 tons of rice from the united states, thailand, china, and indonesiain what tadem described as the highest import level since the miracle rice era of irri began. moreover, even when the country was still exporting rice, citing data from the national grains authority, tadem said that because of the corresponding increase in the costs of production brought about by the irri technology, philippine rice had to be sold in the world at a loss. . . from 1977 to 1979, the total value of the philippiness rice exports reached p590.8 million while the export cost was p665.47 million for a net loss of p74.67 million. true, the country exported rice, but who benefited? farmers bore the brunt of the increasing production costs. according to tadem, the irony that most of them bitterly felt was that higher production and yields per hectare did not result in improved real incomes as the increased costs cancelled whatever gains in production was achieved. tadem also noted that lower net incomes meant that it became impossible for farmers to repay their masagana 99 loans. furthermore, data cited by tadem from lantican and unnevehr shows that real farm wages farm wageconsumer price index actually started to decrease within the period when masagana 99 was being implemented from 1972 to 1977, real wages rose from p3.78 to p5.24. however, from 1977 to 1984, real farm wages have declined by 46 from p5.24 to p2.82. the marcos regime started to lessen reliance on the expensive masagana 99 program in 1984. in one of his ghostwritten books, the filipino ideology, ferdinand marcos claimed that a new government initiative, the intensified rice production program, was implemented in december 1984 to complement masagana 99. it is perhaps more accurate to call it a lastditch successor program to address the shortage that masagana 99 could not. however, irpp was similar to masagana 99 in the sense that it did briefly increase rice production, but led to more indebtedness without increasing profits of farmers. according to a 1985 paper by irri scientists bienvenido juliano and leonardo gonzales although the irpp was launched to provide cheaper credit to rice farmers, the volume of credit it provided and the numbers of farmers covered were less than before. it meant that most rice farmers had to pay very high interest rates. tadem also explained that since the country had resumed importing rice at the time, the market had become flooded, which kept the price of locally produced rice artificially low, significantly affecting the earnings of the local farmers who were already heavily in debt. but marcos continued to tout his administrations credit programs for rice production during the dying days of his regime. based on a transcript of a campaign speech he gave in naga city on january 14, 1986, marcos told his supporters that in 1967 we began to export rice to other countriesfailing to mention that the country stopped exporting rice from 1970 to 1977, and again between 1984 and1985. he emphasized that through masagana 99, we established a credit system which tries to give capital or operational funds to small tenants and farmers who were allowed to enter banks for the first time in the entire history of the philippines and without collateralmasking the fact that many banks and farmers later on found themselves in a worse financial position than before they contracted masagana 99 loans. why masagana 99 remains potent marcos propaganda based on her facebook page and press releases from her office for her masagana 99 propaganda in recent years, imee marcos consistently relied on the manila bulletin column, dated november 5, 2016, titled masagana 99 redux, by national scientist emil javier. an agronomist and plant geneticist, javier was prompted to write the column after president rodrigo duterte said that he wanted to emulate the marcosera masagana 99 and biyayang dagat programs. imee highlights the short sections of javiers column where the brief and qualified success of masagana 99 was described. she fails to include the sections where javier criticizes the program, corroborating much of what was detailed above. according to javier sadly, masagana 99 proved to be shortlived and unsustainable mainly due to the costly subsidies and failure of many farmersborrowers to repay the loans . . . . by 1980, masagana 99 ceased to be of consequence as only 3.7 of the small rice farmers were able to borrow. javier ultimately does not recommend resurrecting masagana 99, saying that it will likely result in farmers defaulting on loans again. giving away seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and dryers, while politically attractive, is temporary, wasteful and prone to graft, javier emphasized. we have been doing that all these years with little to show for the expense and the effort. ferdinand marcos himself, in the last of the books he purportedly authored, a trilogy on the transformation of philippine society, discussed only the establishment and initial implementation of masagana 99, staying silent about its decline and demise in the 1980s, despite the book being published in 1988 and referencing the rice crisis at the time. if this is the kind of data sen. marcos is relying on, small wonder that she has the audacity to claim that masagana 99 was an unqualified success. according to marcos aide arturo aruiza in the book ferdinand marcos malacanang to makiki, the late dictator considered the trilogy to be an unfinished book, hoping that imee would finish it. considering how she continues to propagate disinformation about the marcos regime even during a pandemicto the point that she is suggesting the revival of a failed program to address our current and upcoming coronaviruscaused economic woesit seems that she is on track to fulfill her fathers wish. masagana 99 shows that the propaganda that comes with doling out patronage proved to be one of the most resilient ways to instill untruth. the lie becomes part of the residual gratitude of those who benefitted from the largesse. todays patrons have learned that lesson to perfection. as she ascends greater political heights, sen.marcos seems to want to keep on giving away the peoples money the same way her dictator of a father once did. miguel paolo p. reyes, joel f. ariate jr., and larah vinda del mundo are

13515,X,"from this paper a rosetta stone for understanding infectious drops and aerosols which aerosol fractionrespirable, thoracic, or inhalableis important from a health perspective depends on the agent and its target tissue. in the case of mycobacterium tuberculosis, because the target resides in the alveoli, only the respirable fraction is relevant 7. for a virus that uses a receptor present on the surface of cells throughout the length of the respiratory tract 8, all of these aerosol fractions are likely to be important figure 1. in addition, because the conjunctiva are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 infection, a spray of ballistic drops hitting the eyes or the anterior nares also poses a risk, in addition to the wellaccepted risk of selfinoculation of these sites with fingers contaminated after touching surfaces. when considering recommendations for protection of healthcare workers who must get close to their patients in potentially highly contaminated environments, eye as well as respiratory protection is important. for the general population, physical distance will limit exposure to splash and spray and contaminated surfaces, but will be less effective at blocking aerosols of even 20 to 30m particles that can travel considerable distances. face masks that block shedding of inhalable and thoracic aerosols and reduce shedding of respirable aerosols 9 can be expected to make an important contribution as source control. there is evidence that physical distance, face masks, and eye protection all contribute to reducing the spread of betacoronavirus infections 10. or referencing this image you can get infected through the eyes, and specifically through ballistic drops that land on your eyes, so putting a physical barrier between your eyes and such ballistic drops, helps. ___ as an additional note, another part of that quoted section does tell us of fomite infection or the possibility of picking up virions on ones hands, and then transferring the virions from ones hands to their eyes or their nose or their mouth, if one touches their face. this is why its important to avoid touching ones face, so that the transfer cannot happen disinfecting surfaces, so that virions cannot be picked up by hands washingdisinfecting ones hands, so that any virions picked up by ones hands are removed ___ as a final note, id like to call attention to another study sarscov2 and health care worker protection in lowrisk settings a review of modes of transmission and a novel airborne model involving inhalable particles sarscov2s main entry into host cells is through ace2 receptors, which seem to be largely expressed in the nose 21, 22. importantly, the highest and most consistent signs of viral infectivity have been observed for nasal cells, with a gradient along the respiratory tract characterized by a marked reduction in infectivity in the distal bronchioles and alveoli. this may suggest that lower airways are not targets for infection and that transmission via respirable aerosols is not predominant. interestingly, the typical patchy bilateral pneumonia found in covid19 patients is postulated to be caused by oropharyngeal microaspirations rather than direct viral seeding in the lungs, possibly accounting for the increased risk with age and comorbidities how do we explain that sarscov2 spreads so easily? surprising attack rates have been reported. possible explanations include the high presymptomatic contagion of certain individuals 138, as well as the many asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases 139 who seem to have similar viral loads to their symptomatic counterparts 140. furthermore, unlike sarscov1 which reached peak viral load and therefore contagion at day 7 to 10 from the start of symptoms 141, viral load seems to peak right before the advent of symptoms 108. given these data, certain researchers estimate that 44 of transmission happens in the presymptomatic phase 108. finally, nasopharyngeal viral load appears to be much up to 1,000 times higher than that of the first sars 142. we are therefore faced with a very contagious virus that can silently infect a large number of people. simply put, sarscov2 most easily infects a person through their nose, so if you are wearing a mask, it should cover your nose."
13516,X,"from fb post of dr. edsel salvana, up nih misinformation is picking up again and so im putting this together to correct some of the confusion. part of the problem is that there are a lot of technical terms and people keep misinterpreting. to clarify, i am not an employee of doh, but i do help advise them. as they are really, really busy, i am helping clarify certain items which are easily misinterpreted, particularly with testing and case counts. i help run the upnih laboratory so i am aware of what the testing and lab issues are. 1. testing for covid19 is done with an rtpcr. this is a highly technical process that not only involves having the right machine and kits, but also the proper safety infrastructure like a bsl2 laboratory. many labs and hospitals have rtpcr machines but they do not have the biosafety infrastructure. this includes having sops for emergencies, properly trained staff, even flu vaccines for all your employees. the reason it is so rigorous is because if you are not careful, you will infect the staff and the surrounding community. you cannot compromise on safety for expeditiousness. it is a recipe for disaster. 2. as much as we would like to use rapid lateral flow assays igmigg because of convenience, none of the lateral flow assays have used the industry standard prnt assay. in other words, we have no idea how good they are despite their claimed sensitivity and specificity. the biggest danger is that because it takes 5 to 10 days to make igm antibody, the test has a high false negative rate in those who just started having symptoms. and so you will get a false sense of security and end up passing the virus to other people and your family members. 3. the current number of unique individuals tested is about 2,000. however, because of early algorithms requiring according to many international guidelines for covid19 repeat testing before you can discharge a patient, a total of more than 11,000 tests have been done. this requires that at least 2 consecutive negative tests be done on a recovered covid19 patient before heshe is sent home. this is because we previously did not want to discharge a recovered person who is still shedding sars cov 2 virus into the community. this is an ideal approach, but now with the increasing cases and backlog, doh is shifting to more testing of new cases and will use clinical parameters rather than testing parameters to decide on discharge. 4. covid19 confirmed patients who are discharged without a repeat test are still going to be isolated for 14 days after discharge and may undergo repeat testing afterwards depending on laboratory capacity. in addition, new preliminary data shows that at 8 to 10 days, there is no longer culturable virus meaning viable virus in most people who have recovered even if rtpcr remains positive. this may also explain the report from china of people testing positive again after they recovered they are detecting residual virus genetic material or pieces of the virus, not infectious virus. 5. the lab capacity of the philippines for doing covid19 rtpcr continues to increase. last week it was only 300 tests. now we are at over 1,000 tests, with new labs, including private ones, set to go online. the approval and eventual arrival of the gene xpert covid19 test will add major capacity to test because it takes shorter 45 minutes to run and we already have a lot of xpert machines that we use for tuberculosis. the problem now is that all countries want to get their hands on the cartridges. 6. even if we have 120k test kits and reagents donated, the capacity to process those is still at just over 1,000 testsday. at that rate, we have enough reagents and kits for at least 3 months. if more labs go online, we will use those faster. hopefully the upnih kit will be validated in a few weeks and can help fill the need when we run out of donated test kits. 7. i have already publicly called on politicians to refrain from pressuring doh into doing asymptomatic testing for them and their families. at this point there are only two populations that can get asymptomatic testing 1. healthcare workers who need to return to work. 2. critical government officials. i understand there is pressure on doh since politicians hold their budget. if the government official is critical, then doh can facilitate. but if doesnt fit in either of those two definitions, then please let doh decide on who is appropriate. 8. please stick to quarantine. there have been some spectacular fails from some of our leaders and this is unacceptable to those of us in the healthcare field who are putting our lives on the line. you are putting people in danger if you insist your convenience is more important than the safety of others. i myself am just about to get out of quarantine and it was very inconvenient but i stuck to it for the safety of my family and those around me. 9. my aim here is not to defend doh or the government. i stick to the science. i have a front row seat to what the government is doing, and i would like to share that perspective with the general public. they are working their butts off. we need to help them. if there is a question, do a little bit more digging and not go attack mode immediately. there is a lot of misinformation out there and we dont need any more noise. i have briefed both admin and opposition leaders on their request. this virus doesnt care if you are dds or yellow. if you are unlucky enough to get it and you get severe disease, the only color you will be is

13517,X,"in the philippines, drought again brought famine to negross infamous sugar plantations in 189697, then returned to devastate agriculture on luzon, panay and other big islands from 1899 to 1903. climate stress was alloyed with warfare, poverty and ecological crisis. thus the first phase of droughtfamine coincided with a national uprising against the spanish, while the second overlapped patriotic resistance to us recolonization. the independence movement itself, moreover, was spurred by the growing crisis of food security since midcentury, when spain prodded by britain had launched an ambitious campaign to develop exports and commercialize agriculture. traditional forms of communal land ownership and subsistenceoriented production had been violently dismantled in favor of rice and sugar monocultures operated by pauperized smallholders and debtshackled sharecroppers. spanish and mestizo hacenderos, like ubiquitous chinese grain merchants and moneylenders, were merely links in a long chain of exploitation ultimately controlled by distant british and american trading companies. moreover, as the export boom generated a demand for new plantation land, luzons interior foothills were rapidly deforested, leading by the 1890s to the silting of river beds, more intense flooding, and gradual aridification of the lowlands. in addition, as ken de bevoise has shown, living standards and public health had been undermined by the ecological chain reaction set in motion by the arrival of the rinderpest virus in the late 1880s. arguably the single greatest catastrophe in the nineteenthcentury philippines, rinderpest killed off most of the draft animals on luzon and forced farmers to drastically reduce the extent of cultivation, aggravating malnutrition and debt. meanwhile, untilled land that returned to scrub or vegetation provided favorable breeding conditions for both locusts and anopheline mosquitos. in lieu of its preferred blood meals cattle, a. minimus blaviorstris increased its humanbiting rate, setting off seasonal epidemics that made it difficult for the labor force to work even the reduced amount of agricultural acreage. thus debilitated by malaria and impoverished by the loss of their cattle, filipinos were then exposed to the microbial campfollowers of the invading spanish and us armies. the 122,000 american troops, especially, brought a whole stream of diseases including hookworm as well as new lethal strains of malaria, smallpox and venereal disease. the americans, moreover, exceeded even the cruelest spanish precedents in manipulating disease and hunger as weapons against an insurgent but weakened population. beginning with the outbreak of war in february 1899, military authorities closed all the ports, disrupting the vital interisland trade in foodstuffs and preventing the migration of hungry laborers to foodsurplus areas. then, as drought began to turn into famine in 1900, they authorized the systematic destruction of rice stores and livestock in areas that continued to support guerrilla resistance. as historians would later point out, the ensuing campaign of terror against the rural population, backed up by a pass system and population reconcentration, prefigured us strategy in vietnam during the 1960s. all palay, rice, and storehouses clearly for use by enemy soldiers, writes de bevoise, were to be destroyed. that plan would have caused hardship for the people even had it been implemented as intended, since guerrillas and civilians often depended on the same rice stockpiles, but the fooddenial program got out of hand. increasingly unsure who was enemy and who was friend, american soldiers on patrol did not agonize over such distinctions. they shot and burned indiscriminately, engaging in an orgy of destruction throughout the philippines. as one soldier wrote back home to michigan we burned every house, destroyed every carabao and other animals, all rice and other foods. as a result, agricultural production was so generally crippled during the american war that foodsurplus regions hardly existed. as peasants began to die of hunger in the fall of 1900, american officers openly acknowledged in correspondence that starvation had become official military strategy. the result is inevitable, wrote colonel dickman from panay, many people will starve to death before the end of six months. on samar, brigadier general jacob smith ordered his men to turn the interior into a howling wilderness. famine, in turn, paved the way for cholera which especially favored the reconcentration camps, malaria, smallpox, typhoid, tuberculosis and everything else that rode in wars train of evils. in such circumstances, of course, it was impossible to disentangle the victims of drought from the casualties of warfare, or to clearly distinguish famine from epidemic mortality. nonetheless, de bevoise concludes, it appears that the american war contributed directly and indirectly to the loss of more than a million persons from a base population of about seven million. in comparative terms, this was comparable to mortality during the irish famine of the 1840s. one of the most remarkable local rebellions during the philippines war for independence coincided with the ravages of drought and hunger on negros. on the big sugar island antiimperialism fused with stark class conflict between hacenderos and pumuluyo the common people. the negrense elites to protect their interests against increasingly hungry and dissatisfied workers and peasants ardently sided first with the spanish, then with the american colonialists. they chose the sugar trust rather than aguinaldo. as arriving us military officals discovered, the protracted drought had made these social tensions volcanic. the unusual dryness of the season, wrote the commanding officer of the manapla and victorias districts in june 1900, has operated against the crops and has materially injured the sugarcane. on this account, many owners of haciendas have been forced to discharge part, if not all, of their laborers as they could not be fed. these laborers are now without means and work and the price of food is high. when the explosion came, it merged the grievances of unemployed sugar workers and marginalized peasants with those of aboriginal people displaced from their forests by landhungry haciendas. the largest uprising was led by a zapatalike plantation worker and babaylan, dionisio sigobela, more popularly known as papa isio, who conducted guerrilla warfare against the guardia civil, then the us army, from his base on impenetrable mt. kanlaon. the restoration of food security and economic independence were principal goals of the struggle. although papa isios ideology fused animism with antispanish nationalism, alfred mccoy explains, his movement remained a class, rather than racial war, waged by sugar workers determined to destroy the sugar plantations and return the island to peasant rice farming. in the district around la carlota, papa isios followers chased away planters, murdered those that resisted, and burned scores of haciendas. the rebellion was not finally defeated until 1908, five years after the revolution had ended in most areas of the archipelago. ___ taken from _late victorian holocausts el nio famines and the making of the third

13533,X,"grabe i experienced both leni and bbm rallies today and the contrast between the two is really huge. i met vp leni today and juskolord ang ganda nya. i wasnt at the main rally afaik its not really a rally since it was only supposed to be a caravan but mayor trenas welcomed her with a stage pero nandoon ako sa route ng caravan. the vibe kanina was so festive. people are celebrating when cars passed by with leni campaign materials and when they beeped their horns busina para kay leni. may mga volunteers din na nagbibigay ng libreng tubig. it was a caravan for all ages because mayroong teenagers, mga matatanda, young adults and adults, may bata pa nga kanina arouund 3 or 4 years old na kumakanta ng kay leni tayo. the people are shouting with joy noong nakita na nila si leni. i literally screamed on top of my lungs when i saw her. shes just a couple of meters away from me. shes so prettyyy it was supposed to be a small event only pero grabe andaming tao. you know that youre a good politician if people come to you without something in exchange. di mapapantayan ang energy, kahit matatanda na go pa din sa pagsigaw ng leni! leni! leni! in contrast ang energy ng mga bbm supporters is nonexistent. like my energy during class at siesta hours. unfortunately sa kabilang bayan lang namin ang miting di avance ni alamano. blame the garins for this. as we were going back to our house napansin namin na masyadong maraming ceres buses. as in. i tried to tally the amount of ceres buses passing by pero i decided not to when we reached guimbal. halatang halata talaga na hakot ang mga ito. yung taxi driver namin kanina sabi nya na around 300 people came from aklan. there were also reports na there were hakots from negros as well. i only heard stories of hakot in social media pero iba talaga pag naexperience mo ito. yung kahit saan ka titingin may nakapilang linya ng ceres buses. it is probably more than 100 buses. nagmukhang terminal ang buong guimbal they literally made an effort to hakot their supporters and some who are secretly not from all the provinces in western visayas to create a fake crowds. jusko pati mga baranggay officials are required to attend. the mother of a friend of mine, was a kakampink pero shes forced to attend the rally kasi brgy official. theres a good number of kakampinks hidden in the crowd who were forced to attend or are just there for money. i recall reading a tweet earlier na some people in the buses did l signs to fellow kakampinks pero di nila pinahalata. anyway napadaan kami sa group ng mga mga kakampinks beside the lenikiko mural in guimbal. those volunteers are brave since nakaposisyon talaga sila near sa resort ng mga garins. busina for leni raw so bumisina din kami. i even opened the windows and we all chanted leni! leni! leni! while doing the l sign. the kakampinks most of them are teens and young adults cheered at us back. grabe feeling ko tuloy artista na ako. we were closing by the town center and parami ng parami ang mga naka red na tshirt. they werent even attending the rally. we passed by guimbal national high where the guimbal stadium incident occured and juskolord naka parking ang helicopter ni alamano. obvious talaga na it was an artificial crowd kasi as we reach the town center, theres a lot of people who didnt even bother to attend. nandoon lang sila parang pumapasyal sa guimbal at night. tbh they looked bored. we saw the stage from afar it was positioned hundred of meters from where we passed by and it was grand. its obvious na ayaw mapahiya ng mga garin kay alamano kaya todo effort nila through their artifical crowd and ayuda giving. 1k raw pero first come first serve. limited edition since 5k participants lang ang bibigyan raw. an artificial crowd is still a fake crowd. its funny kung ano ka grabe ang effort nila to make a huge crowd pero not all of those is real, compared to lenis visit na it was supposed to be a small thank you caravan pero andaming sumipot. theres hope."
13534,X,"posting from usavirginia. my maternal grandmother and her sister are buried in the original cemetery in rosario. my lola died in 1939 and my auntie in 1940 both from tb. whilst i still had relatives in rosario, i would often ask them for photographs of the grave sites during undas but never received one. a few years before my mother died, one of my cousins who now lives in the states told her that the grave sites had been taken over by squatters. i understood this to mean that nonfamily graves were added on top of those of my lola, her sister, and my mothers sisters, which broke my mothers heart esp as she had been sending money home annually to the pi for the family plot maintenance. its now been several years since mommas death i need to come to peace with this chapter of family history, esp as the last of her generation is nearly 100 years of age uncles mother was my grandmothers sister, so they were the two sisters buried next to each other. my two questions is there a formal name for the old cemetery? or do i keep referring to it as the old rosario cemetery? does anyone know where this might be and could they take a photograph of an entryway and share an address? second question is it truly impossible to discover where my lola might be buried? church records? town records? i accept that i may never know but i have to try one last time. my lolo was buried at ft santiago but moved to a different military cemetery in the 1960s. i understood that lola wanted to be buried home and thats why they are not together. thank you!"

13537,X,"im sorry but i dont know where else to go. so im going to give it a try here. please help us, where can we find government assistance or any financial assistance to help is cover hospital bills for my dad? he does not have medical or life insurance. only has philhealth and his senior citizen discount. we are just 3 siblings caring for him, and all of us are barely earning due to the lockdown. our families have tried sending help, but they are also barely surviving so they cant send a lot. please help us, we dont know what else to do. this started in the morning of august 12. we were happily having breakfast and my 70 y.o. dad was about to sit down on the couch and suddenly collapsed. he had already lost his bodily functions by then. we rushed him immediately to many hospitals, but sadly were rejected one after another. we were only able to receive proper treatment in the afternoon at uerm, but they also had full bed capacity. he waited in the er for hours while we searched for a hospital. regrettably, we were only able to get a room in cardinal santos, a very expensive hospital, because it was the only one with an icu ready and it was already 4am. at the time, we prioritized getting my dad admitted without thinking about the possible charges. my dad was diagnosed with aphasic stroke, wherein the dominant part of the left side of his brain was hit by the blood clot. this stopped all comprehensive functions sight, hearing, talking, and eating. he can slightly move his limbs but only when he feels pain. he is conscious but can only open his eyes, which will only last for a few seconds and he will sleep again. this is because his brain is still swelling due to the blood clot and causes him to feel drowsy. because he cant control his throat muscles, he cant cough out the accumulated mucus in his lungs. were praying that this will not lead to pneumonia. after 3 days, we finally got him to get transferred to a regular room so we could be with him. but this did not mean he was in a better condition. we could hear his heavy breathing due to phlegm buildup. we were advised to have surgery wherein part of his skull will be removed to allow his swollen brain to breathe, but this would still lead him to become vegetative because of his old age. it will only allow him to stay alive while being attached to a machine. the surgery is also very expensive, minimum fee is at 800k and above. we were also asked to intubate him but we also refused because of the risk of his heart stopping. right now, we are fighting for him but we dont want to push him to become alive for our sake at the expense of him suffering even more. thats why we decided to take care of him personally in a regular room, no matter how long it takes. but this required us to take turns watching him, affecting our daily jobs and it is just us 3 siblings who can take care of him. its just been 4 days now but the bill is already at 273k without the 20 senior citizen discount. weve been asking for financial help from our friends and family, but they are not enough especially because we dont know for how long my dad will be staying in the room. if you have any idea where we can ask for help, please let us know. your prayers will also be a big help to my father. thank you so much."
13538,COVID,"hello, just want to share this story to all of you. my wife by the way has recovered already and its been a month now. thankfully she only had mild symptoms when she got covid. but im going to share how she got the virus so that other people can be informed and can prevent themselves from being infected. march 30, we had a swab test at our house but my bro in law included his staff on that day. staff needed a swab test cert to go to a province. unfortunately, the staff arrived early and she was given a seat at the garage. she was already there about 5 minutes before the person who will do the swab arrived. the garage was a typical open air. she also did not talk, did not cough nor even sneeze. but she put down her mask every once in a while because she wiped her face with a small towel. i think she did this around 23 times. she also had runny nose on that day. come swab time, the first 2 person had their blood test taken and not nasal swab. after those 2, it was my wifes turn and she was scheduled to be swabbed. so she put down her mask only for a few seconds. after the swab, the mask went up to cover her nose and mouth. she was also seated around 2 meters from the staff, and it was not directly adjacent. after my wife, my bro in law got swabbed and then the staff. later that day, we got the news that the staff was positive for covid. my wifes symptoms appeared after 3 days from that interaction. prior to those days, we rarely go out and she had 2 masks on every time and we spray alcohol for every foreign object that we touched. aside from my wife, a yaya also got infected but her symptoms appeared on the 5th day. this nanny went out to the garage without a mask but for less than 10 seconds. she gave the mobile phone to my wifes sister bec someone was calling. i think she was about 12 meters away from the staff as well. this nanny doesnt go out for day offs bec shes afraid and she does not even go to the gate to receive packages or talk to other people. so were pretty sure that she got the virus from that staff. lessons that i learned from this the virus is airborne and 1 meter is not enough. actually, i searched who and it mentioned that covid19 can last upto 3 hours in the air. before, we thought that an infected person needs to cough, sneeze or talk for their virus to spread. but in this case, i think the virus spread when she flipped her towel. there were about 7 people on that garage and only 2 were infected bec the other 5 had their masks on. it only takes a few seconds for you to get the virus especially if you dont have a mask. i heard from someone that you need minutes to be infected. hope this helps"

predictions for the novel wuhan coronavirus. both viruses use ace2 to gain entry into the cell, but it serves normally as a regulator for heart function. myocarditis is a rare complication of many viral syndromes. most commonly described viral etiologies are adenovirus, coxsackievirus, cmv, hiv, and parvovirus b19. we present a rare case of coronavirus related fulminant myocarditis. case presentation nine month old male presented with two day history of cough, rhinorrhea, and fever. initial vitals were significant for respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute and a heart rate of 180

13548,"AURI, COVID","context my wife had fever last night, and now its gone, fortunately. she still has runny nose, cough, body pain just today. but never did she experience difficulty in breathing. anyways, i just wanna know, if there are people here having the same symptoms but far away from the affected areas. we are from bulacan, btw. we kinda can afford to get ourselves checked sa hospital, fortunately, so were definitely going tomorrow. but i really wonder, how would a doctor determine if this is a normal cold or normal flu. to add, im not seeking medical advice, of course, lets focus on the question. thanks a lot! edit there are many factors that we can discuss to the doctor tomorrow, like sinipa ng baby ko yung boobs ni wifey, so apparently when that happens to you a breastfeeding mom, youll get fever according to breastfeeding pinays fb group ha? she had sweets din days ago. i had sweets today plus damn grapes, and now im having mild sore throat. thanks people!"
13551,X,"warning long post ahead due to context. i just got my license last october and opted for a year off. i was tired, i didnt feel like i was ready for residency, and i definitely had plenty of personal issues that needed sorting out. let it not be said that med school is an ordeal in on itself. the boards were just the icing on the cake and what a sour tasting icing it was. i digress. when i said take a year off, i simply mean that i wanted to stretch out on my own, finally do non med related things ive been keeping off the table for so long, and still keep sharp the skills and knowledge ive gainedyes, by working as a licensed physician. after all, a boys got to eat. serendipitous as it may seem, a few days after the announcement of the board passers, there was an opening in a public hospital near where i lived. the pay was considerable, the schedule 24 hour duties notwithstanding was alright and there was a chain of referral present. since it was a specialist hospital i theoretically did not need to worry about certain cases. while adulting was hard literal na parang itatae kayo sa kalsada about the many intricacies of life that med school never bothered to even mentionunless you had a job before med, it was a minor irritation. lesson learned pa din and it definitely wont do to be charged for tax evasion. the first few months were fun if more hectic than i assumed it would be. the chain of command was surprisingly supportive unlike what was experienced by some of us during clerkship andor internship. while i did my best, i still made a few mistakesunsurprising as this was the first real time id be managing things on my own. not once was i lambasted nor abused, and for that i was grateful. constructive criticism and proper advise is so much better than the petty powertripping that seems so rampant in medicinetraining or otherwise. skills remained sharp, i got to know great new people and explored my horizons both professional and personal in ways i dont think residency would ever let me. call me pretentious, but maybe for some, it really is better to learn how to fly first before you walk. also, it really is something else to finally be earning for yourself and be able to give a bit in return to those who have supported you the whole time. all good things must come to an end or as ned stark more fittingly put, winter is coming. come late december, everyone seemed to be happy, still so full of christmas cheer when there came news that in china, neverbeforeseen pathogen has begun infecting people. it didnt seem like a big deal at the time, but it helped to keep tabs. soon enough, the virus we now call sars cov 2 which causes covid 19 was on the news everyday. soon, there were clamors to suspend flights to and from china and other affected areas. temporary naman, just until the crisis abates. im pretty sure a lot of you have seen the news on that last januaryearly feb. and then it started. at first, they were either foreign nationals here for a vacation or for whatever other purpose or ofws, having come from a high risk country with fever, cough andor colds. fever, cough andor colds. as simple as they may sound, the sheer number of pathogenic entities that can cause any or all of these is simply mindboggling. this is where historytaking and physical examination comes in. it was often said that 95 of the time, a doctor can get it right simply through those. lies kill, and we would learn how true those words are in due time. going back, the lab exams, radiologic imaging etc are there not to diagnose for us, but to act as supporting evidence. they serve to identify what the pathogen is for us to give specific treatment if need be, to see if the patient is getting better hence repeat testing for a lot of illnesses, and to see if there is anything new needs to be addressed. thats the remaining 5. so yeah, it was a trickle at first. manageable. or so it seemed. that trickle soon turned into a stream regular hospital protocol simply wouldnt do anymore so the admin made drastic changes. effectively, the hospital i worked in became a specialty center for covid 19 with those changes. our job? the vanguard. the frontline. before anyone thinks its unfair and too risky, our seniors had the far riskier job of actually handling the daytoday issues of inpatients including those who have turned out positive. we adjusted. we made our pleas for compensation heard, and at the very least we were given what was due. hopefully, that fairness stays that way for the duration. having done my internship in the biggest public hospital myself, the eventual frontline seemed a familiar sight. the major difference was the fear. fear spreads faster and goes deeper than any other plague can. it started with that report about the first locally transmitted case of covid 19. suddenly the people came nonstop, some outright demanding to be tested despite being told and being shown the guidelines that we follow. to placate such people is a balancing act in being professional and in keeping ones temper down. it is immensely tiring for mind, body and spirit to do so on a repeated basis. as of right now, the most at risk seem to still be the old andor those with debilitating chronic illnesses. they are the ones who should be tested and admitted if need be. there are no guidelines for vip testing. god forbid the day there would be. we had to swallow the bile, seeing the pompous and entitled put themselves first before the people they had sworn to serve. heck, til now, none of the medical staff in the hospital have ever been swabbed. the reality that we and the other staff members were but lowly ants that can only serve and not be heard at least not out loud was not missed. even our seniors who had a negative opinion on the matter had no choice. rizal once stated it so graciously in the character of kabesang tales and the friars who deigned on his rights and what he knew was just. siya ang palayok, kawali ang korporasyon. go figure. that stream soon turned into a river more changes were wrought in our line of work. more struggles. more. more. more. our seniors had to pull off alternating shifts that is to say they go on 24 hour duties every other day, supposedly to keep their immunities up. it does little to lessen the risk of their contracting the virus which by that point had caused all of luzon to be locked down by the increasingly erratic president. most of us juniors couldnt risk going home. our parents were and continue to be at risk. they are getting on with years and if they were to get sick, then scienceobjective and simultaneously emotionlessdictated that they were most likely to suffer severe manifestations. the communities where we come home too will also suffer thanks to the draconian measures we are all forced to live with. at the very least, the hospital admin gave us lodging and food, and we are grateful for the good samaritans who have and continue to help out in what ways they can. i cannot say the same for other healthcare workers from other institutions. each day brings more patients, and each day the atmosphere becomes more rife with fear or so it seems. the number of cases is rising daily. the risk of contracting the disease or any such similar ones is a constant companion especially for we who actually have to handle patients. the risk is probably similar too for any such patient who decides to get checked in our nowdensely packed institutions by simple proximity. remember droplet transmission has an effective radius of 6 feet. one cough. one sneeze. a lot of people. thats all it would take. outside the hospital, the news still leaves a lot to the imagination, but what is shown seems to reflect a similar condition. its morbidly interesting how a virus is all it would take to lay bare the many, many faults and inadequacies of the system we follow and are forced to endure. rather than lead with a sense of gravity and purpose, we get sad excuses, senseless statements e.g. the kit and many such other examples. instead of a medical solution, we get a militaristic one. hell, a lot of these soldiers probably dont have adequate training if at all for an epidemic. the masks most of them wear are about as useful as tissue paper against sars cov 2. one can hardly blame them for that kind of ignorance at least. it is the possibility of abuse of power that keeps heads turning and fingers crossed. such abuse has happened before after all, lest we forget. what is incredible is that some people have the gall to defend these measures without being offered enough aid nor explanation. instead ano bakit? may naiambag ka ba? sumunod ka na lang kasi expletive has become a de facto reason if you can even call it that. i digress again. the frontline sees us and our fellow healthcare workers exposed in more ways than one. i am lucky that our institution seems to have enough for our staff which number few to begin with. we make do with what limited manpower we have because we dont have a choice. for the larger institutions public and private, ive seen and heard from friends also on the frontline how they have to improvise simply due to a shortage of stocks that those in power are supposed to provide. manpower too is fast becoming a problem even old doctors and nurses who shouldnt pull such long shifts anymore are forced to take the field despite the higher risk they have due to the curse of age. the virus and the menagerie of other microbes in the workplace is not the only thing we are exposed to healthcare workers have to grind too for a living, just like anyone else. work from home is never an option. imagine during the first few days of the lockdown, not a single fig it seemed was given regarding the problem of commuting to and from the workplace or alternatively where they can stay to limit exposure. contrary to what most think, nobody gets rich by working in healthcare alone. most of us dont have cars too. before the present transpo measures were placed, each institution had to think of ways on how to manage an otherwise crippling problem. sarisariling diskarte in other words. imagine that. its even more harrowing now to know some of these healthcare workers have been thrown out like the lepers of old by paranoid landlords who consider them harbingers of disease. mind you, healthcare workers are among those supposed to have a pass to go to and from their place of work for obvious reasons. we have a hard enough time with whats going on. misinformation and paranoia only make it more difficult and dangerous for everyone. what more for the common filipino who holds no exemption? ive felt helpless whenever a patient has asked me how theyre supposed to go home or to pay for private services. i have no true answer nor remedy for that. compound those with the previously existing problems we have in our healthcare system. most, if not all of us, have families and the possibility of never seeing them again is always around the corner. as i write this, a total of 10 doctors, most of whom had been in the high risk age group, have perished due to covid 19. it is a reminder of mortality a reminder that not everyone can be saved. forget that a lot of frontliners are relatively young. we die too. the ones in charge of running the country, flaccid as they are, seem to think that the death of one is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic. i do hope i am proven wrong in that regard. the personal toll is no less painful, perhaps even moreso for patients and those whose lives have been forfeit, most of all. there are dreams now that may never be realized, loves that may never again come alive. there are roads in life closed mayhaps forever not just for we in the vanguard, but for anyone who holds such hopes. it makes one think of what could have been avoided simply by imposing those wouldbe travel bans. alas, it appears that we have been in damage control ever since. while we healthcare workersno, mr. cayetano, sit down stand united in trying to stem the torrent, it is unsurprising and most unfortunate that even we are bickering and arguing about what to do next. then again, were people too. we have flaws too. ive said previously, we die too. there are at least ten names now that can attest to that. we are also afraid. but we cant choose to show that. we want answers from above, same as everyone. when we make ourselves heard, there are consequences that follow. many such answers given too are not all assuring and leaves many a question to boil in a fevered mind. forgive the comparison, but some of us do feel like soldiers being made to go to war without arms. we can only hope that everyone does their part. is this a war we can win? certainly. but we cant win it alone"
13552,X,"so i have a brother, hes 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes nato, hes feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagkacramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo which i am against kasi i think hes having mental health problems talaga which affects hes overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacksdifficulty breathing. but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just dont want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko nangkukulam daw sa kanya, mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na hes done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente ?. hes just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. hes not the typical albularyo rin, nakacar siya and mukha namang welloff. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang godgiven gift. i dont have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwalanagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, hes living paycheck to paycheck and im still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. how can i put it into words parang still stuck sa phase na nasa isip mo lang yan. bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit im reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat maprocess right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and hes asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and hes gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na pag di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really cant process anything right now kasi im thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really wont listen to any of us. edit please dont share this with any platform update i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he wont acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. ill just hope and pray for the placebo effect."
13554,X,"hi! just want to ask if anyone here has experienced the taxi spray modus pero this time sa grab? gusto ko lang iverify kung nauuso na naman siya because i experienced it again tonight. so i went to makati and decided to use grab to go home. i asked kuya na mag skyway na lang para mas mabilis. the trip was initially okay but started to be scary when i noticed he kept on touching a mini container with liquid hung up together with his rosary. napansin ko na ginagawa nya yun kapag nagphophone ako. i didnt pay attention pa rin masyado kasi akala ko may mga simbahan kaming nadadaanan thats why he kept on touching it. plus this is grab so yung tiwala ko was really high. on the third time na nakita kong he touched the container, i started feeling different na. by this time i had difficulty breathing, heartbeat was faster, started feeling disoriented and my mouth and throat started feeling dry. still i was convincing myself na wala lang normal lang pero iba na talaga eh. i opened the window kasi nga parang ang hirap na huminga but it was of little help. what i did was i asked him na ibaba ako. heres the part na talagang naiyak ako. kuya went down narealize siguro nya yung eksena ko, asked me na sumakay ulit and told me maam balik na po kayo. pabango lang po yun. itatapon ko na po kung gusto nyo. pulis po mayari ng grab. kahit kausapin nyo po siya. i was like he fucking knew it. without me saying anything about that fucking container. he knew it. i told kuya no kuya. i feel unsafe sa sasakyan mo. and then i started walking sa skyway deadma na sa mga sasakyan. walked hanggang toll exit and i was ugly crying na while talking to my friend and doon na yung blurry part. patrol cars, more ugly crying while talking to my sisters, being scared to go home and for my familys life kasi baka balikan ako dahil alam nya address ko. ending i wrote a letter na hindi ako magcocomplain sa grab and police kasi ayoko talaga ng hassle at gulo. disoriented na ako and naiisip ko lang talaga was what if balikan ako sobrang panic ko, dinedelete ko grab ko, deactivated my facebook, trying to remove my public pictures sa linkedin. my friend then picked me up. ang lala. still cant sleep because of the trauma. sabi nung taxi na sinakyan namin pabalik ng makati, may mga pampatulog daw talaga na ganun and he asked me if the drivers window was slightly open. honestly di ko na napansin yun kasi nga i was busy with my phone so ayun."
13555,X,"original article few countries give the observer a deeper feeling of historical vertigo than the philippines. seen from asia, the armed uprising against spanish rule of 1896, which triumphed temporarily with the establishment of an independent republic in 1898, makes it the visionary forerunner of all the other anticolonial movements in the region. seen from latin america, it is, with cuba, the last of the spanish imperial possessions to have thrown off the yoke, seventyfive years after the rest. profoundly marked, after three and a half centuries of spanish rule, by counterreformation catholicism, it was the only colony in the empire where the spanish language never became widely understood. but it was also the only colony in asia to have had a university in the 19th century. in the 1890s barely 3 per cent of the population knew castilian, but it was spanishreaders and writers who managed to turn movements of resistance to colonial rule from hopeless peasant uprisings into a revolution. today, thanks to american imperialism, and the philippines new selfidentification as asian, almost no one other than a few scholars understands the language in which the revolutionary heroes communicated among themselves and with the outside world to say nothing of the written archive of pre20thcentury philippine history. a virtual lobotomy has taken place. the central figure in the revolutionary generation was jos rizal, poet, novelist, ophthalmologist, historian, doctor, polemical essayist, moralist and political dreamer. he was born in 1861 into a welltodo family of mixed chinese, japanese, spanish, tagalog descent five years after freud, four years after conrad, one year after chekhov the same year as tagore five years before sun yatsen, three years before max weber, eight years before gandhi, and nine before lenin. thirtyfive years later he was arrested on false charges of inciting andrs bonifacios uprising of august 1896, and executed by a firing squad composed of native soldiers led by spanish officers. the execution was carried out in what is now the beautiful luneta park, which fronts the shoreline of manila bay. on the other side of the spanish world, jos mart, the hero of cuban nationalism, had died in action the previous year. at the time of rizals death, lenin had just been sentenced to exile in siberia, sun yatsen had begun organising for chinese nationalism outside china, and gandhi was conducting his early experiments in anticolonial resistance in south africa. rizal had the best education then available in the colony, provided exclusively by the religious orders, notably the dominicans and jesuits. it was an education that he later satirised mercilessly, but it gave him a command of latin and some hebrew, a solid knowledge of classical antiquity, and an introduction to western philosophy and even to medical science. it is again vertiginous to compare what benighted spain offered with what the enlightened, advanced imperial powers provided in the same southeast asian region no real universities in french indochina, the dutch east indies, or british malaya and singapore till after world war two. from very early on, rizal exhibited remarkable literary abilities. at the age of 19 he entered an open literary competition, and won first prize, defeating spanish rivals writing in their native tongue. he was growing up at a time when modern politics had begun to arrive in the colony. more than any other imperial power, 19thcentury spain was wracked by deep internal conflicts, not merely the endless carlist wars over the succession, but also between secular liberalism and the old aristocraticclerical order. the brief liberal triumph in the glorious revolution of 1868, which drove the licentious isabella ii from madrid, had immediate repercussions for the remote pacific colony. the revolutionaries promptly announced that the benefits of their victory would be extended to the colonies. the renewed ban on the jesuits and the closure of monastic institutions seemed to promise the end of the reactionary power of the orders overseas. in 1869, the first liberal captaingeneral, carlos mara de la torre, arrived in manila, it is said to popular cries of viva la libertad! how unimaginable is a scene of this kind in british india or french algeria. during his twoyear rule, de la torre enraged the oldguard colonial lite, not merely by instituting moves to give equal legal rights to natives, mestizos and peninsulars, but also by going walkabout in manila in everyday clothes and without armed guards. the collapse of the glorious revolution brought about a ferocious reaction in manila, however, culminating in 1872 in the public garrotting of three secular i.e. nonorder priests one creole, two mestizo, framed for masterminding a brief mutiny in the arsenal of cavite. the rizal family was an immediate victim of the reaction. in 1871, when jos was ten years old, his mother was accused of poisoning a neighbour, forced to walk twenty miles to prison, and held there for over two years before being released. his elder brother paciano, a favourite pupil of father burgos, the leader of the garrotted priests, narrowly escaped arrest and was forced to discontinue his education. under these circumstances, in 1882, with his brothers support, jos left quietly for the relative freedom of spain to continue his medical studies. he spent the next five years in europe, studying on and off, but also travelling widely to bismarcks germany and gladstones england, as well as austrohungary, italy and france and picking up french, german and english with the ease of an obsessive and gifted polyglot. europe affected him decisively, in two related ways. most immediately, he came quickly to understand the backwardness of spain itself, something which his liberal spanish friends frequently bemoaned. this put him in a position generally not available to colonial indians and vietnamese, or, after the americans arrived in manila, to his younger countrymen that of being able to ridicule the metropolis from the same high ground from which, for generations, the metropolis had ridiculed the natives. more profoundly, he encountered what he later described as el demonio de las comparaciones, a memorable phrase that could be translated as the spectre of comparisons. what he meant by this was a new, restless doubleconsciousness which made it impossible ever after to experience berlin without at once thinking of manila, or manila without thinking of berlin. here indeed is the origin of nationalism, which lives by making comparisons. it was this spectre that, after some frustrating years writing for la solidaridad, the organ of the small group of committed natives fighting in the metropole for political reform, led him to write noli me tangere, the first of the two great novels for which rizal will always be remembered. he finished it in berlin just before midnight on 21 february 1887 eight months after gladstones first home rule bill was defeated, and eight years before almayers folly was published. he was 26. the two most astonishing features of noli me tangere are its scale and its style. its characters come from every stratum of late colonial society, from the liberalminded peninsular captaingeneral down through the racial tiers of colonial society creoles, mestizos, chinos pure chinese to the illiterate indio masses. its pages are crowded with dominicans, shady lawyers, abused acolytes, corrupt policemen, jesuits, smalltown caciques, mestiza schoolgirls, ignorant peninsular carpetbaggers, hired thugs, despairing intellectuals, socialclimbing dvotes, dishonest journalists, actresses, nuns, gravediggers, artisans, gamblers, peasants, marketwomen and so on. rizal never fails to give even his most sinister villains their moments of tenderness and anguish. yet the geographical space of the novel is strictly confined to the immediate environs of the colonial capital, manila. the spain from which so many of the characters have at one time or another arrived is always offstage. this restriction made it clear to rizals first readers that the philippines was a society in itself, even though those who lived in it had as yet no common name. that he was the first to imagine this social whole explains why he is remembered today as the first filipino. the novels style is still more astonishing, for it combines two radically distinct and at first glance uncombinable genres melodrama and satire. for all its picaresque digressions, the plot is pure melodrama. the novel opens with the wealthy, handsome and naively idealistic mestizo, don crisostomo ibarra, returning from a long educational sojourn in europe with plans to modernise his home town and his patria, and to marry his childhood sweetheart maria clara, the beautiful mestiza daughter of the wealthy indio cacique, don santiago de los santos. at first he is welcomed with respect and enthusiasm, but the clouds soon gather. he discovers that his father has died in prison, framed by the brutal franciscan friar padre damaso, and that his body has been thrown into the sea. later he will learn that damaso is the real father of his bridetobe. meanwhile, the young parish priest padre salvi secretly lusts after maria clara, and has covered up the murder of one of his young acolytes. gradually, ibarra also learns of the sinister origins of his own line in a cruel, cartpetbagging basque, who after ruining many local peasants, hanged himself. he makes friends with don tasio, the local freethinking philosophe, with liberalminded local caciques, even with the captaingeneral himself, as well as with the mysterious indio rebel elias. the dialogues between the two men on whether political reform is possible in the philippines or a revolutionary upheaval inevitable continue to this day to be part of philippine progressive discourse and historiography. meanwhile, the friars and their various local allies scheme to abort ibarras marriage and his plans for establishing a modern school in his hometown. finally, padre salvi, learning of a planned rebel attack on his town, frames ibarra as its instigator and financier. the young man is imprisoned in a wave of antisubversive arrests, torture and executions, but escapes with eliass help, and ends as an outlaw. maria clara, to avoid being forced into a loveless marriage with an insipid peninsular, chooses to become a nun, and compels her real father, whom she confronts with his adultery, to help her take her vows. she disappears into a convent where, however, padre salvi has managed to get himself appointed as spiritual adviser, so nameless horrors lie in wait for the unfortunate girl. so far, so puccini, one might say. yet this melodramatic plot is interspersed not only with brilliant sketches of colonial provincial society, but with the novelists own unquenchable laughter at the expense of his own inventions so that tosca changes into goyas caprichos. consider the famous opening of the novel towards the end of october, don santiago de los santos, popularly known as capitan tiago, was hosting a dinner which, in spite of its having been announced only that afternoon, against his wont, was already the theme of all conversation in binondo, in the neighbouring districts, and even in intramuros. capitan tiago was reputed to be a most generous man, and it was known that his home, like his country, never closed its door to anything, as long as it was not business, or any new or bold idea. like an electric jolt the news circulated around the world of social parasites the pests or dregs which god in his infinite goodness created and very fondly breeds in manila. some went in search of shoe polish for their boots, others for buttons and cravats, but all were preoccupied with the manner in which to greet with familiarity the master of the house, and thus pretend that they were old friends, or to make excuses, if the need arose, for not having been able to come much earlier. this dinner was being given in a house on anloague street, and since we can no longer recall its number, we will try to describe it in such a way as to make it still recognisable that is, if earthquakes have not ruined it. we do not believe that its owner would have had it pulled down, this task being ordinarily taken care of by god, or nature, with whom our government also has many projects under contract. or consider the opening of the novels final chapter epilogue, which comes immediately after the story has reached its grim, gothic conclusion many of our characters being still alive, and having lost sight of the others, a true epilogue is not possible. for the good of the public we would gladly kill all our personages starting with padre salvi and finishing with doa victorina, but that is not possible ... let them live the country, and not we, will in the end have to feed them ... this kind of authorial play with readers, characters and reality which reminds one of machado de assiss sardonic memrias pstumas de brs cubas published five years earlier is quite uncharacteristic of most serious 19thcentury novels, and gives noli me tangere a special appeal. it is what has always doomed nationalist attempts to put the book on stage or screen. it was surely this same laughter that earned rizal the implacable enemies who brought him to his early death. it is impossible to read noli me tangere today in the way a patriotic young manileo of 1897 would have read it as a political hand grenade. we all have the spectre of comparisons crouched on our shoulders. it was only the second novel ever written by a putative filipino, the first being minor, experimental trash. so what about other great colonial novels by the colonised? there is nothing in the americas, nothing in the rest of southeast asia, nothing in africa till threequarters of a century later. what about the comparison with metropolitan spain? it has been said that rizal borrowed heavily from galds, in particular from his 1876 anticlerical novel doa perfecta. but rizals novel is so superior in scale and depth that this borrowing is very doubtful. in his voluminous correspondence rizal never mentions galds whose opinions on colonial questions were wholly bienpensant. the one spanish writer for whom he had a passionate admiration was not a novelist at all, but the brilliant satirical journalist jos mariano de la larra, who had committed suicide in 1837, at the attractive age of 28. and tagore, rizals exact contemporary? here one sees a profound contrast. tagore was the inheritor of a vast and ancient bengali literary tradition, and most of his novels were written in bengali for the huge bengali population of the raj. the mother tongue of rizal was tagalog, a minority language spoken by perhaps two million people in the multilingual philippine archipelago, with no tradition of prose writing, and readable by perhaps only a few thousand. he tells us why he wrote in spanish, a language understood by only 3 per cent of his countrymen, when he invokes t que me lees, amigo enemigo you who read me, friend or enemy. he wrote as much for the enemy as the friend, something that did not happen with the raj until the work, a century later, of salman rushdie. rizal could not know it, but there were to be huge costs involved in choosing to write in spanish. five years after his martyrdom, a greedy and barbarous american imperialism destroyed the independent republic of the philippines, and reduced the inhabitants once again to the status of colonial subjects. american was introduced as the new language of truth and international status, and promoted through an expanding school system. by the eve of world war two, it had narrowly become the most widely understood language in the archipelago. spanish gradually disappeared, so that by the time a quasiindependence was bestowed in 1946, it had become unreadable. not merely the novels, essays, poetry and political articles of rizal himself, but the writings of the whole nationimagining generation of the 1880s and 90s had become inaccessible. today, most of the work of the brilliant anticolonial propagandist marcelo del pilar, of the revolutions architect apolinario mabini, and of the republics tragically assassinated general of genius antonio luna remain sepulchred in spanish. hence the eerie situation which obliges filipinos to read the work of the most revered hero of the nation in translation into local vernaculars, and into american. hence also a politics of translation. translations of noli me tangere into most of the major languages of the philippines were bound to fail, not merely because of the absurdity of the many spanish characters speaking in tagalog, cebuano or ilocano, but because the enemigo readers automatically disappear, and the satirical descriptions of mestizos and indios speaking bad spanish, and spanish colonials slipping into bad tagalog, become untranslatable. the most important american translation, done by the alcoholic antiamerican diplomat len mara guerrero in the sixties still the prescribed text for high schools and universities is no less fatally flawed by systematic bowdlerisation in the name of official nationalism. sex, anticlericalism and any perceived relevance to the contemporary nation are all relentlessly excised, with the aim of turning rizal into a boring, longdead national saint. which brings us to the present translation, more or less timed for the centenary of rizals execution. a few years ago, doreen fernandez, one of the philippines most distinguished scholars, deeply disturbed by the corruption of rizals texts, went in search of a compatriot linguistically capable of making a reliable translation. she eventually found one in soledad lacsonlocsin, an elderly upperclass woman born early enough in this century for rizals spanish by no means the same as 1880s madrid spanish to be second nature to her. the old lady completed new translations of both noli me tangere and its even more savage 1891 sequel el filibusterismo just before she died. in most respects, it is a huge advance over previous translations, handsomely laid out and with enough footnotes to be helpful without being pettifogging. but the barbarous american influence is still there, to say nothing of the basic transformation of consciousness that created, for the first time, within a year or so of rizals execution, a national idea of the filipino. in rizals novels the spanish words filipina and filipino still mean what they had traditionally meant i.e. creoles, people of pure spanish descent who were born in the philippines. this stratum was, in accordance with traditional imperial practice, wedged in between peninsulares native spaniards and mestizos, chinos and indios. the novels breathe nationalism of the classical sort, but this nationalism has to do with love of patria, not with race filipino in the 20thcentury ethnoracial sense never appears. but by 1898, when apolinario mabini began to write two years after rizals execution the old meaning had vanished. hence the fundamental difficulty of the present translation is that filipinofilipina almost always appear in the anachronistic form of filipinofilipina for example, el bello sexo est representado por espaolas peninsulares y filipinas the fair sex is represented by peninsular and creole spanish women is rendered absurdly as the fair sex being represented by spanish peninsular ladies and filipinas. the other problem is a flattening of the political and linguistic complexity of the original, no doubt because mrs lacsonlocsin was born just too late to have had an lite spanishera schooling. when rizal had the racist franciscan friar padre damaso say contemptuously, cualquier bata de la escuela lo sabe, he mockingly inserted the tagalog bata in place of the spanish muchacho to show how years in the colony had unconsciously creolised the friars language. this effect disappears when mrs lacsonlocsin translates the words as any schoolchild knows that. rizal quotes three lines of the muchloved 19thcentury tagalog poet francisco balthazar in the original, without translating it into spanish, to create the necessary intercultural jarring but quoting the poem in the same language as the text surrounding it erases the effect. the ironical chapter heading tasio el loco el filsofo shrinks to tasio, and one would not suspect that the chapter heading a good day is foretold by the morning was originally in italian. the translator also has difficulties with rizals use of untranslated latin. there are a few prophets who are honoured in their own country, and jos rizal is among them. but the condition of this honour has for decades been his unavailability. mrs lacsonlocsin has changed this by giving the great man back his sad and seditious laughter. and it is badly needed if one thinks of all those social parasites the pests or dregs which god in his infinite goodness created and very fondly breeds in manila."

13558,X,"tldr, i was hit by a speeding auv while crossing an intersection with my bike on the way home. curious of how injury claims go into process against the car driver. not looking to have them jailed. tuesday, april 25, 130pm last week was going great day off spent well, watching nba playoffs, ordered food for me and my grandma and then i biked to 711 nearby. quick store run, as usual. pauwi na to eat lunch. did my honest highway pagtawid etiquette, only to be hit by an auv which came behind a slowpaced 16wheeler a bit over 20meters far from the intersection. his speed was i think around 40 kph, more or less. i took the brunt force and fell backfirst. my bike flew as well, together with my 711 paper bag containing snack and soda. my glasses, shattered. if i had my phone with me, itd prolly have a cracked screens and cameras by nowi left it at home knowing ill only be away for 5 minutes 143 pm there were a lot of bystanders who rushed to help. i got off the road and the driver pulled roadside while i was regaining my senses. multiple abrasions, but i felt like i can go home. i wanted to go home and just cry alone for having been able to experience that accident when everything was going so well for the day. bystanders were asking me to get to the hospital but i was feeling all the anxiety and adrenaline hence i declined at first. the driver and his wife said theyll have to be somewhere asap and theyll just call me for compensation after they finished their appointment. seeing that theyre both at around the same age as my grandma, i softened and just told them off trusting that theyll come and contact me back. we exchanged numbers and we got their plate number, only to be declined their drivers license infostill trying to catch my breath at this point and while the bystanders took initiative to ask them, they refused. i know its their right too tho 400 pm my aunt took action later in the day since were receiving no response from the drivers side, and im glad we took it to the authorities. i was tasked by the local gvt police to get a medicolegal check up and xray, to see the extent of my injuries. results showed i only sustained multiple abrasionssugat and my muscles took all the hit basically, bukod sa mga sugat at gasgas sa katawan, nabugbog ako nang malala. im not looking to have the driver jailed for negligence of compensation but rather i only wanted to make sure he wont run awayy. were about to request a subpoenapolice investigator and hospital physician schedules made it delayed til this point for injury claims. im not used to this kind of conflict, and im an engineering graduate so i dont get how legal process works especially for road accidents. edit physically i feel a bit better now, thanks to painkillers and muscle relaxants. still having shortness of breath and relapses which can be a bit traumatic. i got back to my work recently too, since im wfh anyways."
13560,COVID,"yesterday, during the parents plenary in lpu, ive had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoals briefing on ncov and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a scitech editor of my school paper, heres my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyones perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus connoted as ncov is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family sarscov and merscov are its older siblings, it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when theyre prescribed with medicine for the symptoms paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days. how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isnt an airborne virus it can only be transmitted via body fluids coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva. simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected persons sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected however, this isnt necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected persons body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei particularly in the city of wuhan in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered no to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. whats more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 150 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases. we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, theres no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources"

idk. i hope that id really come into terms with this chronic illness. whats really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasnt afraid of how deadly or how potentially lifethreatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. ive always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i dont know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i cant even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and thats convenient so i dont have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, im still yet to see. its going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update hello, ive read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words im very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, its just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments how did you acquire it? i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasnt really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, ive mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung insertive sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. im thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na its rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didnt get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didnt bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, id get sick na. it was every week na id get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didnt want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin. i know its very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didnt have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na im weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. thats the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 you decide the date thats most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you. i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, its gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free"
13599,X,"my mother told me to forget what has happened long ago. when leni ran for president, people started to watch smni because bbm attends the debate in smni. my mom supports bbm. my mom sent me to the philippines 3 years after the fact. my perpetrator is my step father. my mother had children with him after. they got divorced but still live in the same house to save money. when i asked my mom not to support bbm, she would not budge. her biggest contributor, rita gadi. even if there are very shady people surrounding bbm. including, quiboloy. she supports du30 too. darry yap? i told her the values of what i see in leni. we are both not a registered voter but the principle remains the same. my mom is supporting a person with most questionable character. ps. i was 5 and had fever when i was molested. my mother still made me shower with my perpetrator after the fact. my mother and i no longer talk after i clearly saw the values she upholds. i do not hate my siblings, i hate the act and while i can forgive, i did not get justice. so when people tell me smni is just an avenue that justify the means. get your values checked. quiboloy may not be guilty in the philippines but he is a televangelist who calls himself appointed son of god. i do not see why we tolerate smni as journalism."

13601,X,"hi! just need some advice for our rights regarding a construction next door. its been causing health problems for my toddler, not once, not twice but thrice already. we even decided to live temporarily in his lolas house in a different city because we noticed every time he goes back home, he has an allergy flareup and he has spontaneous coughing fits. this third time, it already escalated to a fever and hes currently on antibiotics so i was wondering what are our rights, if we do have one? its not only him, but everyone in the household too bc of our allergic rhinitis but the effect is worse on him. appreciate any advice! thank you!"
13602,X,"last friday, i was absent on my work because i had a really intense panic attack. im a trainee in a call center, and it was my first time taking calls last thursday. the reason for my panic attacks last friday was that i felt really terrified of taking calls that i spent hours crying, and i felt like i would rather just die than take another of those calls. coz i mean, if youre also working have worked in a call center you get me when i say that the customersclients can really be mean and put you down like youre some garbage right? anyway, to add, i have social anxiety, and i am diagnosed with bipolar 2. it really also doesnt help that the calls are not scripted, and you have to really converse with the customer on your own. this is my first job ever, and i didnt expect it to be like that. im good at english and all, but the words that i heard affected me too much the next day. idk if it was my bipolar getting triggered, but long story short, i decided to just take a day off for my mental health. i can really be impulsive, and suicidal when im in this state, hence why i thought it would be right to take a pause for a day. philippines isnt really great at understanding and handling mental disorders. so, i just thought it would be okay to just tell my trainer that ill be absent because i have a fever instead of saying im having a severe panic attack. well now i have a problem because the work is requiring me to provide a medical certificate and fit to work clearance within 24 hours of my absence because i said i have a fever. so, what i did was, i went into nowserving and booked myself an appointment. i got a virtual consultation with a doctor and was able to provide the certificate clearance. i thought it would all be fine but turns out, virtual consultation, they said, is invalid and that i still need to have a face to face consultation today. that its a protocol that even if i do get a facetoface consultation with a doctor today, they are still requiring me to either quarantine myself for 7 days or get a rapidswab test. i cannot afford either to not work for 7 days or afford to get a rapidswab test. i need money because therapy is not cheap at all, and i need to support my family. idk what to do. i dont know if i should just beg or just tell the truth about what happened. im worried that if i tell the truth, it would impact on me negatively. note im 19, and i was on my 3rd year of college. family and financial problems happened, so i needed to quit college. i dont have a bachelors, so getting a job that pays enough is quite hard. also, no disrespect please. i am just really in need of advice."

13625,X,"at 6am this morning kagawad julius sevilla announced the permanent shut down of the popburri homeless shelter at 67 k8 street east kamias qc. this was in response to the decision made by our barangay captain octavio bing garces on march 27. the reason for this shutdown is the violation of the quarantine protocols enforced by the barangay. for the record, we at popburri learned along the way to enforce the protocols required. yesterday we are proud to have set up stations in the effort to comply with the quarantine protocols, namely mandatory fever check with two fever guns, mandatory health interview, mandatory bleach and soap foot wash, mandatory shower, mandatory face mask, mandatory bag check for all items, and 1 meter distance in sleeping, eating and lining up. last night 72 homeless clients slept safe and sound under these protocols. unfortunately, these did not meet the requirements. the lord gives us leaders in our nation that see further than we can, and often are more knowledgeable in many aspects and therefore we respectfully honor the decision made by our barangay leaders. today at 4pm, we will be distributing grocery bags with the donations given by all of you wonderful popburri friends, customers, neighbors and nagmamahal na mamamayan. we will also be driving around to locations where the karitons sit within our community to distribute goods until this lockdown ends. thank you for the opportunity for our team michelle, jethro, ejohn, coco, char, lois, john, jay, noy, lowell and camille to witness bayanihan in our community, and gods hands at work to help the most vulnerable. i hope this is only the beginning of the process to get them permanently off the street and hope together we can create an alternative, long lasting solution to our issue of homelessness. love, the popburri team"

13627,X,"this post is a reaction to that tiktok video rant about why football isnt as popular here. nakikisabay siya sa world cup fever, i know, but to be honest, its normal na mainggit, kasi nakakainggit naman talaga. one major reason why football is not that popular is the abhorring lack of proper sports infrastructure. unlike basketball and volleyball na pwedeng gumamit ng multipurpose court anytime, anywhere, football fields and stadiums are very few and far in between. take note, politicians and those working for dpwh and the local engineering offices, alam kong lurkers kayo dito. because, really, our football stadiums suck!! manila, marikina, bocaue, clark, at bacolod lang may matinong standalone stadiums. probably the ones in marawi, roxas city, vigan, and puerto princesa as well, but all of them are simply too small. most of the stadiums we have are built alongside school grounds, like the ones in tuguegarao, lingayen, makati, lucena, iloilo, cebu, cagayan de oro, and zamboanga. same case with the new stadiums in san fernando, laoag, and sorsogon city. perdices in dumaguete naman was built at the back of the provincial capitol, the result is wala nang room for expansion. tapos, kung may matinong sports complexes naman, theyre mainly built to host the palarong pambansa and theyre either built right smack in the middle of fucking nowhere or pinabayaan na lang matapos ang event. this is the case in tubod, siargao, san jose de buenavista, imus, bian, and ilagan. so in terms of accessibility pa lang, bagsak na. football stadiums are supposed to be accessible to everyone, whether they be local football teams na nagpa practice, people jogging at any time of the day, or other people utilizing them as venues. but we definitely lack proper infrastructure to support homegrown groups, let alone a national football league. we have to clamor the government, both at the national at local level, to invest more in sports, kasi kulang na kulang talaga."

13630,X,"its been over a month since i had a successful medical abortion ma. i live in the philippines and its illegal here. found a helpful group of women on facebook and they helped me throughout the process. i found out i was pregnant last week of january. dec and jan are such busy months in my line of work that i couldnt even recall if i had my period for both months. i finally took a pregnancy test and two lines appeared almost instantaneously. my boyfriend and i are both financially unstable. were also far from ready to be parents. and tbh, with how the world is turning out, i find it absurd for anyone to subject another human being to this cruelty we call lifeliving so we agreed to have it aborted. luckily, i am a nursing graduate and a bit knowledgeable about the process of how to terminate birth i am not a nurse anymore. since i am still in my first trimester, i know that i can abort it through oral medication. we searched all corners of the internet for the pills needed. found several websites like women on web, safe2choose, etc, which led me to this certain organization for womens health. a friend also suggested an fb page that also advocates womens health, but they dont reply promptly. my boyfriend and i decided to visit one of the clinics of the said womens health org a day after we got a positive pt. and as expected, they were only giving postabortion care assistance. legally, thats the only thing they can offer for help. the volunteer from the said org was the one who urged me to get a transvaginal ultrasound tvs. just so everyone knows, you dont need a doctors referral to get one. a missed period and a positive pt are enough reasons for you to get a tvs. while waiting for my tvs result, the volunteer who urged me to have my tvs sent me a text referring me to a person who she said can help me with this dilemma. we immediately texted the number. he replied and said he was a doctor and was offering me a surgical procedure. he was really pushy which i find really sketchy. also, i dont want to opt for a surgical procedure. so we parked that option first. a few days passed and that fb group that also advocates womens health replied i was able to talk to the sweetest nurse over the phone. she wasnt at all judgmental about my decision. unfortunately, she doesnt have a source for the pills, but she referred me to fredlis group of doctors and gave me the assistants contact number. i did find several rappler articles about fredli while doing the web rounds before the nurse from that fb group even mentioned them to us. we contacted the number she gave us and they replied promptly. we didnt proceed with them because they are way out of our budget and the assistant and all the written documents that they sent over sounds really rude. but i am not taking that against them, i know theyre just extra careful because it is illegal after all. while all of this was happening, i was also talking to a seller i found on facebook. she invited me to one of their group chats with other sellers and customers. on the group chat, they post proofs and testimonials customers may also ask questions. you may observe before purchasing. they eventually gained my trust when several customers on the group chat i messaged privately attested to them. they have several packagessets depending on what trimester youre in. they cater up to 6mos of pregnancy, i believe! i purchased the package recommended to me and paid thru gcash. received the package the next day it was wrapped in a very discreet manner. i spent a week on the preparation my seller told me to do before proceeding with the procedure. she told me to do heavy exercises, drink pineapple juice and ginger tea pinakuluang luya multiple times daily, and several other things i cannot attest to if it did help. i was already on my 7th wk and 3rd day when i was fully prepared to undergo the ma procedure. the set i got has 6 misoprostol cytotec, 4 mifepristone, and 6 methergine. my seller guided me throughout the procedure via chat and gc. the procedure was overall ok except for the part that i needed to hold for several hours to what seems like a very watery poop. the cramps during the procedure were very tolerable for me as well. had a mild fever in the first few hours. on my fifth hour of taking the meds, i was able to push the fetus out along with the placenta i can send you a photo if youre not that squeamish. hehe! postabortion was way worse than the procedure itself. i never had dysmenorrhea in my entire womanhood. i have a high tolerance for pain as well, but those cramps postabortion kept me in bed for several days. the pain was so painful i had to take ibuprofen for it. the bleeding was also intermittent. i was bloodspottingfree after 34wks. it has been a month and a week now since i had a successful medical abortion. i just took another pt this morning, and it is now negative. i am also on the first day of my period since i had an abortion. yey! fyi you should take a pt after 34wks of a successful ma, and it should be negative. i never fully realized how compromised we are as women with the current laws we have for womens reproductive health until i got pregnant and needed an abortion. ma is such a simple and safe procedure and yet we are not provided with that choice in our country just because . i hope noone has to go through this same experience, but if ever youre in one, dont hesitate to message me. i am more than willing to help. p.s. happy womens month!!! mabuhay ang mga kababaihan!"

13633,X,"this covid epidemic is rearing to be the biggest natural disaster that we have faced since typhoon yolanda. even as early as now the economic and social impact is starting to affect the country, especially the poor and the working class. unfortunately, things are likely to get worse. each one of us will be affected, but not all of us will be affected the same way, and that may be the key to cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the lot of us. pain is inevitable, but suffering can be optional. if you can still remember how the entire nation cooperated to help out after the typhoon yolanda hit, so should it be, if not more so, now. there is no weathering this storm without making sure your neighbors weather it too. were all in this together. if theres nothing else you can do, lets be kinder to one another. if you have a surplus, share. it does not have to be charity. patronize peoples livelihoods. if you have a choice between giving your money to a corporate business and a family store, go for the store. if you need services, you can still avail them as long as you take the necessary precautions to prevent transmission. money circulating the community means food for stomachs, medicine for illnesses. if you can afford to tip, tip graciously. it may not mean much to you, but it could be a life changing choice down the line for somebody else. if you have money to lend, lend. if you have food medicine and supplies to spare, share. if you have talents, what better time to make them shine and what nobler a reason if for another person? if you have nothing but a mouth to speak out of, encourage. assure. if you have nothing but a listening ear, hear people out. be more understanding of other peoples plight. everybody is going through something one way or another. emotions will likely be at fever pitch due to this. but now more than ever we need to stick together. now is not the time for division, disagreement. there is nothing to be gained from gloating, from bickering. people who are right will not be spared from danger any more than people who are wrong. instead of arguments, we need dialogue. instead of insults, we need information. there will be plenty of time to discuss semantics once the weather has cleared, but for now, the more we are all on the same page about what is going on around us, the better our chances will be. sincerity is the key to understanding. and understanding is the key to cooperation. we will likely never have the same political leanings. the same religion. the same preferences for what we thing is right or just. and that is just the reality. what we have the same of right now is the same danger that is facing not just us but our families, our friends, our community. our nation. we can criticize, but we also need to cooperate. we can disagree, but above all we need to compromise. help each other. be gracious in accepting and magnanimous in offering help. start in your small ways. ask to pay things forward. for if theres anything more infectious than covid19, it is kindness. it spreads far and wide beyond checkpoints and quarantines, beyond religious, political, and geographical barriers. it is afraid neither of shadows nor the light. it stays with people. it changes people, even if a little, that it goes on to reflect on everybody else exposed to it. there will be no easy way out of what we are facing and we are all called to do our part in our own ways big and small. but if there is nothing else, be kinder. thank you for reading. edit holy shit this blew up. grammatical mistakes and all. thanks everyone. as the great jackie moon once said, everybody love everybody!"

13642,X,"medyo maiba naman, medyo nagkakafatigue na din ako with the election fever. as the title says, nagkainteraction na ba kayo with someone you felt had psychopathic tendencies? this thought actually came to me since i was watching some true crime videos and criminal psychology on youtube jcs, ewu, etc., and seeing that the genre is quite famous na din ok netflix, maybe marami na ding nanonood here. anyway, nanotice ko na may mga iniinterview sila sa cases na former classmates ng criminal, and that they already shown signs even then. this suddenly reminded me when i was in 3rd year high school, where we had a transfer student. he looked relatively normal naman the most notable lang siguro is yung minor speech impediment nya. anyway, since its already late in our high school lives, medyo established na yung friend groups, and he wasnt the interactive type borderline weird. since may mga aloof naman talaga, we didnt really mind at all. i talk to him periodically, para hindi siya sobrang distant sa section. now, the obligatory talk what you did in you summer vacation thingy is pushed onto us, pero put into drawing. para daw may konting twist. twist my arm, i thought. everyone had the generic answers basketball, swimming, tulog, etc. this guy was also a gamer. heeeey, nice, at least may common ground na ng konti. he drew a counter strikecall of dutygeneric fps protag for us to see, then explained na he was into this. we didnt know him too well, kaya we brushed it off. i didnt mind, since fps was pretty good and addicting naman for others. we kinda had small talks with gaming things, and the he opened up that he was into guns more. waaaaaay too into guns, as in he was shooting a barrage at me with too much gun info. i frankly cannot keep up, nor care, kaya i just shut up and let it go, thinking nothing of it wala kasi akong prejudice about hobbies and interests. nothing really came of it anyway. and then he just didnt attend school after a few days. as in nothing. i never heard anything about him up to this day, nakalimutan ko nga din yung name nya eh, since i never took notice of anything at the time. pero on retrospect, watching these on youtube, napaisip ako is that a sign of a psychopathic tendency? or am i just watching too much of these things? then i proceed to watch some more. share your stories for a change of pace!"
13643,X,"did you ever notice that despite the 5 day classes from 7 to 5 you still do less and learn more than todays self learning and online classes? i remember last year that despite my common absence from school always sick i have no problems coping with anything. i miss 3 weeks of classes? easy. teacher talks and i can learn without even taking notes except on very specific things. i remember before october 5 i was sure that the modules will be easy to understand and answer but oh boy was i wrong. the essay parts are easy but when it comes to understanding the lessons you would spend more effort just trying to get even the slightest idea of what the passage was talking about. confusing grammar, not enough details, no proper illustrations on equations. its a mess a friend of mine in college says he has a lot of deadlines and he has fever at the moment. hes basically powering through to pass his requirements. maybe its just my time management thats the problem, but everytime i look at the modules my motivation just gets sucked out of me. i just feel like its even more work than being in school listening to teachers. anyway, my point is its not engaging nor enjoyable, not even informative and just a pain in the head to do. you just cant get the motivation to even write anything because the only thing pushing you to do it is the weekly deadline. to all my fellow students out there, take a break from time to time for yourself."

13649,X,"yesterday, president duterte signed executive order no. 128 this temporarily lowers the inquota tariff from 30 down to a staggering 5 . the above quota meanwhile is lowered from 40 to 15 . for the uninformed, inquota tariffs simply means an imposed tax or duties within the prescribed minimum access volume mav or import quota any import beyond that is subject to above quotaoutquota tariffs. at first glance, it seems sensible to allow more pork imports to resolve an undersupply of pork. that is, if you believe that its totally an issue of supply. note that even the department of agriculture in early january and february did not believe that the spike in pork prices was an issue of supply. now, the cheapest farmgate price is at p180 per kilo in general santos city. provinces near metro manila is around p200 to p220 per kilo. thus, for the samahang industriya ng agrikultura, a retail price between p330 p380 per kilo is only acceptable. can we blame our local hog producers for the african swine fever asf and restricted transportation? the real score the problem with pork is a problem of distribution the shortage in luzon was a result of it being the hardest hit in the region of asf, while there really is a surplus in visayas and mindanao. in line with the problem of distribution, farmers called for govt to compensate asfhit pork producers and subsidize the transportation of pork. another proposed resolution was to ask malacanang to declare a public emergency, to allow the da to realign funds to address asf infestation, in the form of fund assistance. lets compare that to the imported pork. did you know that the data from the bureau of customs boc shows that the declared price or landed meat of swine averaged at p81 per kilo from january 2020 to january 2021? how much do importers sell it for retail? p350 to p450 between january and february when local pork registered spikes! just imagine their profit margin! who profits besides pork importers? well, their international partners. other countries wanting to open the philippine economy and flood them with imports. heres what an american senior trade editor wrote the philippines, already a big importer of u.s. pork, is lowering its tariffs to allow for more foreign supplies as the country continues to battle african swine fever, according to an announcement made wednesday by the national pork producers council. ... the expanded market access is expected to generate significantly more u.s. pork exports to the country. anyone with a sense of history knows that our history is a history of free trade. so why did the department of agriculture retracted? profit, profit, profit, people. and kickbacks! from confidence in supply to recommending a 650 increase in minimum access volume. jess cham, president of meat importers and traders association, and their group even pegs the meat supply deficit at six million metric tons senator lacson actually already raised concerns over an alleged moneymaking scheme in the importation of meat. an insider information estimate revealed by lacson said that a syndicate within the da collecting p5p7 a kilo from imported meat may earn tongpats amounting to p6 billion a year. lacsons number, however, was capped at 400,000 metric tons, while dutertes a little over a week ago pushed it to 404, 210 as recommended by da. if true, kickbacks would exceed beyond the 6 billion estimate of lacson. do note, however, that mav or import quota doesnt mean quantitative restriction, 15 outquota tariff itself is too low to import more and more. in line with this, da already allotted p45m for freezers or chillers to be distributed in metro manila in wet markets for the imported pork. but whats p45m compared to billions of kickbacks? with that hog raisers warned that they will be forced to stop their operations, for the effect alone of 350,000 metric tons is equivalent to 8,000,000 heads of hog that would flood the market. such numbers would render local hog raisers incapable of competing especially with the threat of african swine flu. the government, thus, having lowered import tariffs effectively served them their death sentence. this country already failed to industrialize and now they want to kill industries that provide for food security. this is a country that when local products dwindle, they liberalize without support for recovery, expecting local industries to compete and magically become efficient. do you even think that with the recent rice tarrification law, rice production will recover even up to producing surplus? sa totoo lang, import if needed. but that has long been abused by the government, technocrats and foreigners that enter the market. we need efficient monitoring. kaso lang ang karamihan sa atin nakatuon lang sa presyo. sobrang tuwa natin kung mababa ang presyo dahil sa mga import, kahit pa at the expense of our agriculture and other local industries. magtataka pa ba tayo kung bakit wala na nagbabalak na pumasok sa agrikultura? napakasuperficial ng efforts ng pamahalaan na manghikayat ng kabataan na pumasok sa agrikultura eh pinapatay naman nila ang industriya. god forbid na kapag nagkagiyera, without food security even the capability to make bullets on our own, this land will fall to its knees. kawawang pilipinas. masyadong marami na ang baboy sa pamahalaan."
13650,COVID,"cause week before i got sick i shared meals relatives who returned home from japan and singapore that couldve been possible asyptomatic carriers. first day i got sore throat but i had a late night milktea kasi so akala ko yun lang yung cause blurry kasi sick but i experienced body pain prolly after nung first meal with said relatives then simula nung sore throat, had fever then asthma na super lala for 5 days then i went in for check up na. i got myself checked then i was confined for a week. first time even after getting pneumonia twice before to be plugged with oxygen. i obviously got better enough to be released and then had a follow up check up and had meds prescribed. as of now im okay already but since i was not tested for covid19 and i experienced all the symptoms even vomitting i wonder if i had it and survived. p.s. simula pagkalabas ko i had all my family wearing masks na all the time keep them stocked with alcohol in fear na they might bring it home to me,its been more than 14 days and no one showed signs naman with everyone who had close contact with me. throwaway because of the stigma and because i just want everyone to question the number of cases we have. if i might have really gone through it how many cases do you think go unreported? how many deaths are not counted and chalked up to pneumonia and asthma? edit i received some hateful dms saying i lied at put people at risk...especially after a doctor died because someone lied..i didnt do it intentionally. i was upfront with my what happened to me during my check up and that i had relatives from japan and singapore. i was honest on the paper sheet the hospital makes everyone fill up which mostly just asked if i travelled to china or have close contact to wild animals. my doctor may have not been briefed to have cases like mine to be submitted for testing and i wasnt tested. while i feel bad for what i may have unintentionally done......blaming me for the shortcomings of doh and this government just made me feel glad i made a throwaway account. i have now called my barangay officials and explained my case they just suggested i self quarantine unless i have symptoms again. from now on ill start eating my meals in my room and stay here for 14 days."

13659,X,"by his own admission, he was on selfquarantine i quarantined myself since march 11, 2020, and already tried to limit my movements. his wifes own words he had been in quarantine for weeks in a separate bedroom. n.b. for weeks lets be somber and check how the koko pimentels fare visvis the following filipinos in similar circumstances a 60yearold man in caloocan died last saturday because the injudiciously planned lockdown prevented him from getting transport to his dialysis sessions. his thriceweekly dialysis was his only chance to live a productive life, but he had lost access to the treatment. in just a week of lockdown, his body had bloated. he died of kidney failure. but for koko and his wife, they had the privilege to forumshop for hospitals. denied at one hospital, they proceeded to makati medical center. the brothers gerald and mark libiran are both in the health care frontlines. gerald is an aide at the philippine orthopedic center who works 10 hours a day, three times a week. mark, his brother, works at the national childrens hospital where he had just completed four days straight duty. the brothers were on a motorcycle to take the twohour ride to their santa maria, bulacan home. with no public conveyances, that was their only way to reach home and rest for the next hospital duty. they were flagged down for violating the prohibition on back rides, despite showing work identification cards. my heart sunk when i learned that the penalty was p5,000. thats half of my salary for the month, said gerald. but for the pimentels, the license plates of a senators car facilitate ease of entry, plus other support vehicles for bodyguards. the 69yearold homeless dorothy espejo sleeps on the pavements of malate. she was apprehended by law enforcers, booked at the police station for a mug shot and charged with resistance to authority. but to where could a destitute itinerant have gone home? a home for dorothy is the governments solution. the arresting police instead told her they needed to set an example. yet for koko, the justice secretary was quick to say, the doj will temper the rigor of the law with human compassion. koko said his selfquarantine started march 11, the last day of the senate sessions. we all know the senate became pestilent after a committee hearing resource person had later tested positive. we go by his own account that led to his selfquarantine march 14 he started having body pains and flu symptoms he then slept in a room separate from his wife march 18 he had a 38degree fever and sore throat. he was correct for following the protocol that as a person under monitoring he came from a risk area, he manifested the symptoms, selfquarantine was required. lets be redundant to take his word for it he tried to limit his movements and slept in a separate bedroom. on march 16, five days after his selfimposed quarantine, he went shopping at the membership club sr at bonifacio global city. he checked out at counter 13 at 159 p.m. he breached his home quarantine protocol. he lied. cctv cameras did not. grocery workers are frontliners, too, for being at the receiving end of viral risk. when kokos test came out on march 24, sr bgc had to quarantine those within contagious distance of the selfquarantinedbutlied former senate president. the homeless dorothy espejo is in jail but not koko who did not use his kokote. dr. israel bactol and others who succumbed but got their positive test results only after they had died is not pardonable when the marcos family got theirs in only a day. in a pandemic of chasm between the rich and the poor, the defenseless perish first. koko pimentel and a government with no compulsion to protect its citizens have just prescribed the recipe for mass panic and mass contagion. bong go can go breach the metro manila quarantine again when a fire breaks out in another city like he did in butuan city. mediocrities of haughty entitlements and militarism to solve a medical crisis? strikethrough all vip entitlements. written by by antonio montalvan ii"
13660,X,"q how would you grade the first 100 days of pres marcos? a i would do what ive done with every president. first, i will ask what did he inherit from his predecessor? then i will compare what he has done in his first 100 with his inheritance to what his predecessor did with his in his first 100 days. the first 100 are first steps in a six year journey so they are merely an indicator of where the president will be taking us up a hill or over a cliff? there will be course corrections or maybe none as the journey moves forward or backward as the case may be. thats why i believe the first 100 is a mere indicator of where the president might take us. having said that, let me share what i felt during the first 100 days of previous presidents starting with gma. i was living abroad during the entire term of cory and the first 2 years of fvr so i cant compare fvrs first 100 to corys nor eraps first 100 to fvrs. gmas first 100 made me happy and relieved and her second first 100 in 2004 made me feel the exact opposite. but looking back, ive realized the alternative in 2004 would have been a first 100 for fpj who made movies difficult to watch for even 100 seconds. and after she took her oath in 2004, her successor would have been noli de castro. in short, the alternatives could have been really disastrous. pnoy gave me the same happiness and relief i felt during gmas original first 100 and for the most part that feeling stayed with me for six years. there were a few disappointments here and there, nobodys perfect, but overall he didnt make me feel let down. my optimism remained high all throughout his presidency. dutertes first 100 were unbearable and so were the rest of his remaining 2090 days as president. bloody corpses in depressed areas, embarrassing and cringey appearances on both world and domestic stages, corruption so unbridled that not even a pandemic could slow it down, total destruction of institutions of checks and balance vital for the survival of democracy and the rule of law. and im just getting started so lets leave it at that. and now pres bbm. first ill be honest. i was very disappointed leni lost and fearful bbm would become another duterte. but it is what it is so lets move on and compare his first 100 to dutertes first 100. pres bbm made some good appointments and some awful ones calida glad he didnt last 100 days, enrile, bersamin, and sara to name the worst choices for vital positions. and he also neglected a vital appointment. up to now, he has not appointed a health secretary despite his having extended the covid public health emergency until december. he radically departed from duterte on matters most important to duterte 1 he met with biden to recalibrate our bilateral relations and by so doing tempered dutertes fevered romance with xi jin ping, 2 he shared a well thought out reservation about bringing back the death penalty, and, in the greatest departure of all, 3 announced a drug war policy that would focus on stemming supply i.e. go after big time drug smugglers and dealers instead of the little guys whose corpses duterte loved to use as props for his war on drugs. further he will focus on educating the youth on the dangers of drug abuse and he will undertake the rehabilitation of addicts. similar to lenis humane approach on drugs so, barring any course corrections, his war on drugs will definitely be humane and rational compared to his predecessors which was barbaric and insane. i fully support bbms position on the death penalty and the war on drugs. there are opportunities he must not let pass in the coming 2090 days, opportunities that will allow history to judge him on his own merits rather than as marcos junior 1 the assassination of radio commentator lapid must be solved with both the assassins and masterminds brought to justice asap. one does not have to ennumerate what bringing those involved in that murder will do to put meat on his pronouncements regarding his commitment to human rights, press freedom, the rule of law and his abhorrence for violence and criminality. related to this would be strengthening the commission on human rights with legislation and certifying as urgent the enactment of the freedom of information bill. 2 he must appoint the right person to chair the coa. that will correct the bad impression created when he appointed calida, a duterte stooge who raised eyebrows in coa over contracts his familyowned security agency entered into with several govt agencies including congress while he was solgen. pres bbm must appoint a coa chair who will lay to rest any doubts about his stated commitment to clean and honest governance. related to appointing an uncompromising coa chair, the successful prosecution of crooked govt officials will happen only if ombudsman samuel martires is replaced. martires can only be removed through impeachment but he can be persuaded to resign. pres bbm must also certify as urgent those necessary amendments to the bank secrecy law and amendments that will make the antimoney laundering agency more effective. 3 set the example for other branches of govt, i.e. congress, judiciary, and constitutional bodies by issuing an order mandating that all salns of executive branch employees be posted online. goverment works best when given the right working conditions. as vp leni never tired of reminding us, sa gobyernong tapat, aangat tayong lahat. finally, beware of optics in a society that suffers from a huge wealth disparity. pnoy was attacked by his own dilawans when he bought a used porsche with his own money. he ended up having to sell it immediately. one does not have to sleep under a kulambo, eat with his hands in a carenderia, and wear a kamiseta although it will be good to keep in mind that those antics produced a net satisfaction rating of 81 for one president."

13662,COVID,"for all those who are currentlly working, i advice you to stay healthy, not only because its essential, but because being sick in this dilemna would cause you so much trouble more than you can imagine. this is just a throwaway account i work at the back office team at a bpo company. i am one of those who opted to stay at the place where i work before the ecq started so that travel wouldnt be an issue, and i will be able to provide income for my family in the middle of this crisis. this thursday, i felt very cold, so i went to our companys clinic.turns out im feverish. when i was asked what might be the cause, i told them i took a bath without sleep as the comfort room is crowded in the morning, and its almost next to impossible to have a bath, so i thought it would be better if i took a shower after my shift before going to sleep. because of the protocol and the current ecq, i was advised to go home as i need to self quarantine myself for 2 weeks, which i took because theres no quarantine facility where i work, even though im only feverish. i was fetched by the companys private vehicle and took me home. now the bad thing starts from here. what i rode is a van, but because of concerned citizens who saw me on my way home, they mistook it and reported and spread to other neighbors that i rode an ambulance vehicle instead. i chose to ignore it, then the worst thing happened. come this afternoon of friday, all of the passages that leads to our home inside and out has been blocked by either water drums,sack of garbages, a wooden ladder or a metal rooftop. we felt very harassed, or should i say, we were harassed. we can see barangay officials tanods watching us from afar, observing us if we ever left our house. the front our house was sprayed by an disinfectant. that was fine, i can accept that, but the fact that thy still leave it blocked until evening left us very angry and offended. it took a shouting of my mother to all of our neighbors just to remove all of the things that blocks the passages to and from our home, she was crying, because were not infected with covid, i just became feverish so i needed to be sent to home. and even though all the passage blocks have been removed, the officials of our barangay called my mother and told her that she was not allowed to go outside and advised that instead give it to the officials in the checkpoint and let them buy from her. but my mother cant accept it because not only she wants to buy her own food, even though we were pleading to just allow my mother to be able to go outside, theyre not allowing it. as we are all pums right now. i talked to the barangay official and pleaded again if, for the last time, just let my mother go outside as she has quarantine pass and she is obeying the protocol and disinfecting herself and all, but they said they cant allow it. i told them its not really in me who also has the final decision, but my mother too. they told me that if we continue to persist and be stubborn, i wont be able to get a certificate from the barangay that indicated that im fit to work. that was the worst part. because im the one who is providing for my family. our father left us because he got tired of fulfilling obligations, and its only me and my mother that are doing our best everyday to support my younger brother, who i hoped someday he can be someone who can finish college, unlike me who was an undergrad and needed to stop because i haveto support them instead of our mother the only one supporting the both of us. i dont know if its the right way to describe it, but i felt like my job was put on the line because i just had a fever. fine, harrassment is something that can be punish by law, but thats beyond our capabilities, and we dont want to enter that teritorry. were just a little family barely scraping by to be able to live through tomorrow. i dont know if im entitled to be right. someone might just that, you need to obey it, but no, it does not come that easy, the damage was already done, and it was massive. it wouldnt be much of an exagaration if you can call me a crybaby right now. i just wanted to share this, and i know im not the only one who experienced this kind of situation. i want you to know that its not just the virus that is our enemy."
13663,X,"for anyone else wondering heres my previous post about her help me raise 8k php for my dog nala we succesfully gathered around php 3k with all your help and im really glad and amazed what you people can do for a strangers dog. maraming salamat po! sincerely from me. so im posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. may 22 around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa rphilippines nala isnt getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but shes not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know its a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila his original vet clinic so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. at furry friends clinic i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex hindi ko po alam spelling pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. shes positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me whats on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections. they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mangeanti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because itll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. shes still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. her favorite spot on my chair latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya. im here to post this update to thank you guys for the support. masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, shes recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left. 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations. please dm me for account or gcash. thank you so much!"

13672,X,"just to help out the rest of us who cant buy masks, heres how to make your own gas mask from water bottles you can find filters for masks in hardware stores like ace hardware or home depot. you can find n95 masks recommended by who at big hardware stores if your pharmacy runs out. remember, corona virus can also be transmitted through the eyes, so make sure you wear shades, glasses or goggles if you can. avoid rubbing your eyes for now. and make sure to wash your hands and use alcohol. hand sanitizer is not enough. avoid public places. stay home to reduce the spread. and the most important thing is to not panick. if you feel that you suddenly have a fever, cough, and trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. vicks and vaporub jokes aside, your life and health is no laughing matter. attention if you guys really want to have masks, i dont recommend it since i dont think they can block out viruses like the facemask you can buy at bangketas with coco martins smile, but you can buy filter masks and respirators at hardware stores if you can afford it, buy dust respirators that p3 grade or higher. here is a picture of all masks that will work with viruses share that last link to loved ones and friends. i highly implore you to click that link for you to know what the correct mask is to buy. oh, and someone reminded me. redacted. if it came from a chinese supplier, that has been tested by another human by wearing it. you can sanitize it with uvc light be careful with using uvc light or just ensure that it remains untouched days including transit in the box for 5 days so that the mask selfsanitizes after 5 days. thanks to uheadhuntermomo for bringing this up"
13674,X,"ive read a post here about appreciating parents, and then i thought i also appreciated how i learned from my evil parents. 1. never beat a person without good reason they do that when they are moneydeprived and fails to steal from me 2. never sleep heavily again, i needed to learn this so no parent of mine could try stealing from my waistbelt and thus i can escape quickly in bad situations 3. ask for two sides of the story one gossip is enough for them to beat the living daylights out of me that i had my head stitiched four times in total, and those rumors turned out to be false 4. criticize in the privacy of my own head they do that all the time, and thus they avoided destroying their image as good parents from the neighbors 5. never cheat since my dad is a cheater and this had led to too many headaches for us sibs 6. if you are going to commit to a promise, do so mine always lie with promises and never follow up to it 7. get good friends who have only one bad habit or none my parents are very good at pretending to be normal but they are psychopaths, and i noticed that they dont have vices so people cant see them for what they truly are 8. get to know a person well before spouting a secret or a heard rumor my mom was a local human cctv, until she died 9. appreciate every meal i never leave my plate with even one grain of rice, since i experienced going without food for four days and nights as a punishment for getting my grades low from 94 to 92 10. do not get more than what you need my parents want to collect everything, and this hoarding problem is one of their bad quirks 11. spend wisely they have money issues since they are both shopaholics 12. be self sufficient if you cant even trust your parents, who can you trust to help you 13. dont be prideful to accept help they dont want us to accept help, since it would reflect on their image that they cant provide for us and how about you?"

13680,COVID,"from dr. edsel salvana understanding testing for covid19 and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isnt as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rtpcr. rtpcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rtpcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rtpcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a probable case even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture fever, cough, pneumonia is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratorybased elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure in contrast with clinical testing, it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible? it really depends on how you define it. if you define mass testing as populationbased testing, meaning testing everyone regardless of symptoms and exposure in order to pick out those infected, then it is not feasible and not useful. a. there is no point in testing someone who is not exposed and has no risk. it is just a waste of money and may come back as a false positive. b. even if you test everyone and they are negative, it doesnt mean they will no longer be exposed to the virus the next day and become a carrier and a case afterwards. c. even rtpcr will fail to detect virus within the first three days of the incubation period and you will miss a lot of asymptomatic someone without symptoms carriers. d. antibody testing for asymptomatic carriers is even worse than rtpcr they will not be positive because asymptomatic carriers havent produced enough antibodies to make the test positive. antibody tests become positive about 7 days after the symptoms show up and are best done after 14 days of symptoms because antibody levels are low until someone is on the way to recovery. e. testing everyone to determine the percentage of the population exposed is epidemiologic testing and can be done with a representative sample. it is a waste of money to test more than you need. a proper sample for communitybased testing of the entire philippines has been calculated to be as small 4,000 to 5,000 people. this is a far cry from doing 109,000,000 tests which is not necessary or advisable. if by mass testing we mean testing everyone who is at risk, then the government is already trying to do it and is paying for it. this is called enhanced targeted massive testing. a. this approach is the same approach that south korea and germany took. it is the same approach to which all the countries aspire. if you look at the world map in the first picture below, we are testing all patients with symptoms, which is a liberal approach compared with most countries in the world. in fact some lgus have been testing asymptomatics with exposure using rtpcr. b. not a single country has used rapid antibody tests for determining clinical disease in patients. only rtpcr is reliable enough to do this. the mass testing approach of south korea and singapore used rtpcrs, and only in those at risk. none of them used antibody tests to detect clinical disease. c. the who recommends against using rapid antibody tests for clinical decisionmaking. it can be used for research and epidemiologic testing, but not to decide who is sick or not. this may change as we get better tests, but for now it is too risky and maybe even deadly to base policy on unreliable tests. 3. are we doing enough testing? isnt more better? the who has pegged adequate testing as performing at least 10 tests for every one test that comes back positive. testing capacity has improved by leaps and bounds along with increasing healthcare facilities. currently we are doing about 16.3 tests for every 1 positive that comes back. that is better than the usa which is at 7.8 and nearly the same as germany which is at 18.6 2nd picture below. as a third world country, we need to conserve our resources. doing too much testing will divert limited money that we can use for our social amelioration programs and economic stimulus packages. there is a global shortage of materials, and if we use up what we have too early, we wont have any more materials to continue keeping track of the pandemic. this isnt going to end anytime soon. we need to be efficient with testing and not overdo it to the detriment of our resources and future capacity. 4. what is the best test to clear people for work? the best test to clear people for work is to check them for symptoms. symptomatic covid19 is responsible for 85 of transmission. the doh and psmid have already released guidelines to this effect and it is clear no need to do laboratory testing to clear people for work. but what about the asymptomatic carriers? there is no good test to completely eliminate asymptomatic transmission. this is why we need to covidproof the workplace with daily symptom checks, wearing of masks for everyone, physical distancing, handwashing and disinfection. neither rtpcr nor antibody testing will pick up all your asymptomatics. 5. why do some private companies want to test their employees? and why wont government pay for it? in my discussions with many private companies, a lot of them really want to do something to reassure their workforce that there is no covid19 around. even if scientists tell them that rapid antibody tests are not good enough to rule out asymptomatic spread and even rtpcrs can miss asymptomatic carriers, we realize that this may have a positive impact on the wellbeing of employers and employees. these companies say they are aware that the tests are imperfect, but they wish to proceed as they think this has some use either from an epidemiologic perspective, or to boost workplace safety practices. doh and psmid recommendations are that this kind of testing is unnecessary and not cost effective. but since this is a free country, as long as you use a properly validated kit and the employees consent they shouldnt be coerced into testing, then that is their call. companies will have to pay for testing outside usual parameters because the government cannot pay for testing that is not costeffective or in line with current evidence. of course, if an employee develops symptoms, then rtpcr will be paid for by the government according to doh and philhealth guidelines. there is also a private initiative to do serosurveys. this is a welcome effort because the governments resources are being strained by many things. the private sector has been a major partner in the covid response and the country cannot thank them enough for continuing to pay workers salaries, giving tremendous ppe and laboratory material donations, and maintaining solidarity in tackling this problem. i hope this document clarifies things. we are all one big filipino family, and like all families we fight from time to time. i think in the end we all want to protect our loved ones from this virus, and the passion with which we are all trying to do the right thing sometimes lets us get carried away. we are only in the first round and the only way to win is to stick together and help each other out."

13684,X,"hello po. im an incoming college freshie whos an aspiring doctor in the future. the three schools i mentioned are my current choices as for now. kinukuha na kasi ni dost kung ano ang school and course ko sa college nakapasa din po ako sa dost st undergraduate scholarship. nagexam din ako sa upcat but im not very confident na papasa ako dun saka wala pa rin ang upcat 2020 results. now, im torn kung saang school ba ako papasok. i wonder if you can give me your opinions naman po and help me decide update i passed upcat 2020 po! bs nursing in upm. thank you po sa lahat ng responses! ust honestly, i really want to go to school here. bs med tech po nilagay kong course, and i was able to thankfully pass. if ever dito ako papasok, i will be able to enjoy a 100 scholarship daw kasi i graduated shs as rank 1. kaya lang i am worried kasi baka hindi ko mamaintain ang scholarship ko. kung sakaling mangyari yun, mahihirapan kami since i come from a lowincome household. i wish i could say na ill try my best and surely i can finish my premed course without spending too much but i feel that that would be too idealistic since di ko naman alam kung sino ba mga makikilala ko dun at kung ano mga mangyayari once magaral na ako. also, marami rin ang nagaadvice sa akin na wag mag ust kasi mahirap daw ang byahe at lagi daw baha kapag rainy season. plm plm is quite a complicated case for me. nakapasa kasi ako kaso ngayon ko lang naalala na bs bio pala ang nilagay kong first course dun. e naipasa ko siya. akala ko talaga nursing ang first course ko pero di pala! shushunga shunga di ba? sorry na po. i really dont want bs bio as my premed, pero nanghihinayang ako sa libreng tuition fee sa plm. sa pinagtanungan ko, di daw pwede na nursing ang pasukan ko kasi bio ang ipinasa ko, at strict daw ang pagtanggap ng college of nursing sa mga students na first choice ang nursing. mcu manila central university po ito. ito ang pinakamalapit na school sa amin kasi sa caloocan ako titira kapag nagcollege na. med tech din ang kinuha kong course dito. neutral ang opinion ko sa mcu. its not my dream school, pero i wouldnt hate going here too. kaya lang nanghihinayang ako sa ust or sa plm. if ever makakapasa ako sa up, automatic na dun na ako papasok, kaya lang tulad ng sabi ko di ako confident na pasado ako dun. sumasakit na ulo ko kakaisip kung san ba dapat pumasok. di naman nakakatulong mga pinagtatanungan ko kasi ang sinasabi nila sakin kung san ko daw gusto pumasok, dun daw ako. as if naman ganun lang kadali yun, i have to consider all the consequences, the pros and the cons, di ba? kung binabasa niyo pa rin po to, thank you po sa time niyo at sana po mabigyan niyo po ako ng opinion niyo. salamat po!"
13689,X,"tldr sandro marcos is not wrong, but who gives a flying fuck about a technicality. the philippine peso, like other currencies, have weakened severely against the dollar. the us dollar is strengthening because of three reasons 1. the us federal reserve central bank is raising their interest rates. meaning, us bonds will give better interest rates. so investors will buy dollars. 2. global uncertainty. the us dollar is a safehaven currency. meaning, if times are tough, people hoard dollars like people who hoarded alcohol and tissue during the pandemic. 3. our reliance on imports. imports arent bad, but if your only solution to high prices is imports, you cripple your industry and subject yourself to fx risk and material risk from the exporting countries. also, you weaken your currency low demand peso, high demand dollar to prove the dollar is so fucking strong, heres a list of asian currencies and their respective depreciation against the dollar 1. hkdusd 0.6 2. sgdusd 6 3. idrusd 7 4. twdusd 13 5. phpusd 13 6. krwusd 17 7. jpyusd 22 if you compare the peso to other currencies, you get mixed results. so, this means the peso, relative to other currencies, is stable. while the peso, relative to the dollar, is weak. so, from a technical perspective, sandro marcos is correct. but as my tldr says, who gives a shit? i dont buy gas, shoes, cars, food, clothes, books, etc with fucking japanese yen or great british pounds. unless you soley import tea and scones from the east india trading company, youre going to need fucking dollars. almost everything in the global market is bought with us fucking dollars thanks imperialismcapitalism. so, the effects of the weakening peso is felt by all filipinos and the techinicalities the marcos camp offers do nothing to help. there are a few things the ph can do to strengthen its currency 1. sell dollars this is why our international reserves are dipping. its more of a shortterm solution to temper volatility 2. raise interest rates which we are doing very slowly 3. reduce import dependence which we are not doing 4. improve exports which we are not since we are content exporting people to sum up everything, sandro marcos is correct. but the effects of a weak usdphp exchange rate is felt by everyone, the technicality offers no comfort, and the phs response to the sudden weakness is lackluster."
13690,X,"in my facebook i decided to share everything positive about other candidates than leni, hoping some soft bbms will go and hop over to isko, paq and ka leody. sorry, ping, i dont like you now. then when i checked mannys campaign pages and his followers i feel sad. its generic videos and pictures of mannys motorcade and rallies a lot or martial law awareness posts this is really a good and our allies, but then it doesnt help grow manny himself. theres no tagline or catchy phrase i can pick up unlike unity of the unithieves, kulay rosas ang bukas and i cant even figure out paquiao colors or symbol theres a popular video of paquiao making a speech and the audience is touched, but its in his native language and without englishtagalog subtitles. i cant see any celebrity endorsements, if there is one, its unpopular if i missed some things after scrolling a few minutes, then i guess they arent visible, right? overall in textbook formula of winning candidates, pacquiao should have been popular. a year ago we are speculating that its going to be sara vs paq vs bbm. pacquiao has the components of 1 poverty to success 2 not part of a dynasty 3 a great campaign material of perseverance as an athlete and being the pride of the nation 4 hes rich because of boxing, not because of politics, just like how marcos got rich due to his hidden gold bars s but i feel his campaign team, or whoever is backing him up and pushing him to run, has a really weak strategy over the years. pacquiaos success story in life should have been at least villarlevels back in the 2009 elections. they probably got complacent and thought mannys name and success in senatorial elections are enough to gain momentum. while one can say his homophobic remarks brought him down, its really not, since he still won the elections after that. id say besides complacency of his camp, his overall lack of charisma in politics, it also didnt help he was a soft duterte supporter turned critic. with his criticism, manny alienated dutertes cult of loud, online, bullies. people forgot his inspirational rags to riches story and the spectacle of his boxing, perfect action star narrative that would have resonated with a lot of people. im not saying i want him to be president, like a lot of here, i just want him to remain as a philanthropist. however, im just sharing my thoughts on how ineffective his campaign had been and why people flocked to other options."

13700,X,"hala! tumabapumayat ka is a phatic expression meant to signify one is in good health or warning that one is not eating enough. we have a generational gap where the previous two generations didnt have food security. our grandparentsparents literally starved to death during the marcos era. i am not saying that fatshaming didnt exist during those time periods, though. i do not have the study to support such claims. nowadays, we have relatively better food security i.e. not starving. gaininglosing weight is more or less caused by psychological health anorexia, bed, etc rather than economic constraints, not to mention the distress caused by its effects. i do think that painting the entire picture helps us better in explaining why calling someone out for their physique is counterproductive and detrimental to ones mental health and bridging the generational gap is a huge help."

13704,COVID,"by now, the australian case is quite well known but here it is anyways confirmed case, woman in her 60s who arrived back in australia on march 3, is believed to have returned from the philippines. her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight. taiwan case disclosed last night case is an over30yearold male who resides in northern taiwan. he traveled to the philippines with his friends from february 28 to march 3. he had diarrhea in the philippines on march 2. after he returned to taiwan, case went to a clinic due to having a dry throat and tiredness on march 3. he went to a hospital and was reported as a suspected case on march 4. infection with covid19 was laboratoryconfirmed in the case on march 5. related investigation suggested it is an imported case linked to the philippines. please note, i have written ph may have exported. i am not able to definitively say both cases originated here. they could have gotten it from another traveller on flights sure, but it is likely that those people either caught the disease in the philippines, or have since spread the disease to others in the philippines. ph needs more proactive testing examination of pneumonia cases, as well as a strategy to test the asymptomatic cases. there are definitely cases here that simply are not getting caught and tested. be careful all."
13705,X,"most people are trained to think logically and rely heavily on scientific evidence that we now describe whats happening in the survey results and sorties as a paradox. still a very conservative way to think right? we wouldnt want to cry out baseless accusations for fear of seeming uneducated or illogical or emotional would we now? okay so lets ask questions then and examine whats before us. first, the percentage of voter preference for marcos jr. its more than the majority and even described as unprecedented. no candidate has ever gotten that much voter preference. the tainted past of this candidate regardless of his strong misinformation network is already suspicious, 60 voter preference is not realistic. strong misinformation network notwithstanding. lets circle back to that later. granted that the disinformation network has been working since 2016 to revise and erase the rottenness of the marcos era the question is where are those informed enough to know what really happened? quickly, in the facts first podcast a professor has studied the misinformation in social media and its role in this election and she has said that as early as 2016, soon as marcos jr lost there were already youtube channels churning out false information favoring him. so back to the question where are these anti marcos folks? a were they swayed by the revisionism? b there were so few of those people to begin with that the disinformation has really taken hold c is the anger and disappointment towards the pnoy administration so strong that they would be swayed theres a sub question under letter c. wouldnt these people think yeah, pnoys admin mightve been flawed but isnt the marcos admin much worse? so why go back to a system thats even more broken? if surveys were a snapshot of a given time period shouldnt certain events in that time frame affect the surveys? a veteran political strategist alan german, said that marcos jrs refusal to attend debates negatively affected him. he also said that it was a considerable backlash as they had a qss quick sentiment scan done on social media. he was asked if this was an echo chamber and said that no because it was done on accounts not associated with their camp. how come the surveys didnt reflect this? also the tax evasion case against him was highlighted again. one would ask, are the majority of the filipinos so blinded and fooled that they wouldnt take these into account? regarding the surveys themselves. lets just say this out in the open. and this is not widely asked even. whos commisioning them? the manpower involved has to be paid. and these surveys are not used for studies. these surveys are used as a pr tool. so lets take note of that as well. aside from that elephant in the room question, these are itemized questions and observation surveys may say that sample selection is random but we also need to know about how the data was gathered in terms of the interview itself or how the data gatherers conducted the survey. questions like 1. are they properly trained did they conduct the interview in a professand neutral tone of voice for example as an aside, there are survey questionnaires that have a certain amount attach to them meaning each questionnaire filled out would mean an interviewer would be paid. also there are anecdotal reports of interviewrs filling out the surveys themselves due to tiredness etc. 2. control mechanisms implemented to ensure accuracy of the protocols in data collection criterion 2 was taken from a statement released by the up school of statistics in response to survey legitimacy and kalye surveys. as far as i know these surveys dont discuss this in their survey report we can safely say that these are blind spots for all of us who refer to surveys. i think these questionsobservations are moot if the survey is just a pr tool commissioned by a confidential client that can not be disclosed by the survey firm. so here it is. when the numbers are not adding up we usually dont trust what our eyes are telling us and we conservatively give preference to the scientific data. but isnt there also a saying about how the simplest answer is the correct answer. how about the idea that the numbers are not consistent with what we are seeing and feeling simply because they are lying. lets just go back to the voter preference mentioned earlier, it seems more likely now that its another tactic. one, for those voters who tend to vote for a likely winner bandwagon effect. and to layout the groundwork that this candidate is the clear winner for when they lose and stage a protest. remember if they use misinformation and propaganda isnt the survey another propaganda tool to be misused? just look at the history of fraud and depth of deception done by these people and tell me that survey manipulation is a stretch."

13712,X,what are your thoughts in the upcoming 2022 elections? heres mine. 1. pdplaban would have an advantage in new normal election campaign because it already has the strong infrastructure for it aka troll army. 2. leni robredo will most likely run. but it will be a hard campaign for her. 3. a third party will most likely win the presidency. a candidate that is not under the yellow or red banners due to partisan fatigue. 4. bongbong marcos is more likely to run as president than sara duterte. who would you vote by the way?

13716,"AURI, COVID","just curious if anyones also experienced this, especially since theres a minisurge in people getting sick in manila. i know so many people who got covidsymptoms yet tested negative in their antigen tests. my sister got exposed to someone with covid symptoms. day 2 after exposure, they notified us of their symptoms, and in day 3 we also started feeling sick. i already got covid before and i had a hunch its covid again since the symptoms felt alltoofamiliar but this time, milder. my sister took an antigen on day 3 and she tested negative. her friends who were also sick also bore negative antigen results. i took an antigen test on day 4 and i also tested negative. however, i also took an rtpcr test the next day day 5 to be sure which also showed negative results. i already feel much better at day 5, but it got me thinking if we really got covid or not? because all the symptoms i felt when i got infected 4 months ago were exactly the same headache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny clogged nose, fever, except milder didnt get a fever this time. i also immediately took medicine for covid on day 3 when i felt the symptoms so that might be a factor as well to the decreased symptoms fast recovery? or maybe a new milder covid strain? or a new flu"

13720,X,"just for posterity i was surprised and delighted by the inclusion of relatively obscure songs in the setlist. yoko? very apt today with rotc to be forced down students throats again soon kamasupra? poormans grave? buddy singing tama ka with an intro about beginning to like the song as he got older implying that he hated it before was superb. everysong where raimund was lead vocals was included. paruparong ningning! slo mo! and he was visibly having fun singing each of them. but probably as tradeoff, other hits were skipped. no more time for kailan, harana. would have loved to hear as well tindahan ni aling nena, blue jeans, tuwing umuulan and any one of the no royalty fillers. the eheads was the first band confident and hardheaded enough to have senseless ganjazz and zappa rant as official tracks would have been perfect to do one in this concert. but no one gets all their wishes. ely was earnest. i watched pupil live several years back in a bar, and im pretty sure he was phoning it in then. he was eager to do his best singing here from the getgo. superb backup or true main? musicians. at several points, you know that the rhythms and leads much of the load, really were not being strummed by the band anymore. there were also miscues and missteps throughout, even in the middle of a song, but audrey dionisio and mikey amistoso were saving all of them. and mad, mad respect for jazz nicolas who was doing keyboards, triangles might even have a cowbell somewhere there. and he was truly elated playing in the gig, from beginning to end! i like the eksena where raimund stood up from his drums during pare ko and just roamed around the stage, shooting with a gopro, while holding in his other hand a glass of red wine. one can interpret this as the other alpha male of the group egotistically prancing about, or simply someone wanting to drink during a multimillion concert, in the middle of a song, and actually doing it. ely tugged him to sing a line of pare ko. he did. all of us are aware of the issue with marcus adoro. there are people who are defending and emphasizing on the independence of art from the artist. there are also parties saying that the exchange posted by his daughter is between a daughter and a father, that bottom line thats marcuss way of talking to his daughter. this is clearly wrong. to say that theres no anguish caused by marcuss words is plain wrong. what im looking for though is whether or not marcus continued supporting his daughter. theres no info here. if hes not supporting, i surely would have skipped this or joined the chorus of removing him from the event. i thought marcus will sing panahon, as he rehearsed. but he just inconspicuously occupied his far side of the stage throughout, and remained the one bandmember who did not have a solo. and the monitors were just scatteringly focusing on him. i entered college when eraserheads was already very popular, but they were still playing sunken garden at very cheap or free! prices. they were also joining our rallies and strumming a tune or two in the mob. they were never greedy. if they need the retirement money right now, they all deserve to get the dough. people are also harping now about the moneygrab that is the upcoming world tour. of course its going to be a moneygrab. why not maximize the rehearsals and all the preps you spent months for? and again, they were not one of those fabulouslyliving stars even during their heyday. its time for the band to secure retirement money. a friend was warning hard about the disorganized mess that happened just a few days before, in a benben concert. this one was relatively organized. the gates separated and there were plenty of ticket attendants at each entrance. you can see how far even the gold section was just from walking between gates. theres just an unavoidable horde at the end leaving the venue. i can imagine cars trying to get out of a jam caused by throngs spilling out of pavements for hours. i parked at okada, walked back after the concert, and took naiax, did not encounter any gridlock going back to qc. prices were falling on the day of the concert. i already got three platinum later shared to college friends comped from a supplier. bought three from here at reddit at 60 off sticker all these tickets were zero cost as printed, sponsorcomped at seller side. a colleague bought two more from facebook marketplace later shared to clients. a seller was offering me 5k for moshpit two hours before the concert. another friend got two moshpits bought for 15k total 24hrs before. this discounting is always probable to happen in big, open grounds concerts. i watched in vip, because i thought the moshpit was going to be a true narrow cramped moshpit where people stagedive. but it was a wide swath with free spaces, instead. diagrams in posters were vastly inaccurate. audience were from all age groups. im surprised to see 20somethings knowing the lyrics better than me late 30s. i still feel the fatigue from all the standing, jumping, swaying a day after, but its mostly happy memories. if you are overseas and they are touring near you, grab the chance. i hope they do one more in mnl next year. there was magic in listening to music you have skipped for decades because of overplaying them at their peak. you get to appreciate again the lyrics that are unpretentious and representative of a generations angsts. i want to experience again moments where every single one around me were singing to many songs. all imploring puwede bang itigil muna ang pagikot ng mundo?... priceless."
13721,X,"perpekto ang girlfriend ko, basta susundin mo lang ang kanyang mga rules ni tristan martin narito ang isang story ko tungkol sa mga kakaiba, weird, at creepy na list of rules type na type ko talaga ang ganitong genre!. kayo, may jowa ba kayong mga mga kakaibang mga rules? ako na yata ang pinakamasuwerteng lalaki sa buong mundo. napakaperpekto kasi ng girlfriend ko. kung baga, wala na akong hahanapin pa. napakaganda niya, sexy, sobrang bait, may sense of humor, matalino, at napakarami pang iba. kung ililista ko lahat ng mga katangian niya, tiyak aabutin tayo ng year 2025! madalas ko ngang kinukurot at sinasampal ang mukha ko para masiguradong hindi ako nananaginip. apat na taon na kami ng aking mahal na nobya. noong niligawan ko siya, lahat ng mga kaibigan at kapitbahay ko sinabihan ako na huwag ko na raw ituloy dahil bad news daw siya at mapapariwara lamang ako kapag naging kami. na may something daw ang pamilya nila sa probinsya. bagong lipat lang ako sa lugar na iyon at magaanim na buwan pa lamang doon nang makilala ko ang nobya ko. hindi ako nakinig sa mga sinasabi nila, mga tsismoso at mga tsimosa, at itinuloy ang panliligaw. hindi nagtagal, sinagot din niya ako at talagang sobrang ligaya ko simula noon. lahat ng mga nagsabing mapapariwara raw ako, hindi ko na sila mga kaibigan ngayon. last year lang, nagsimula na kaming maglive in. kumuha kami ng condo sa taguig at talagang sobrang saya namin. halos wala kaming problema, wala kaming anumang away. at siyempre, dahil iyon sa sinusunod ko ang mga special rules. well, wala naman talaga siyang special rules para sa akin. kung ano ang gusto at ayaw ng mga pangkaraniwang babae sa kanilang nobyo, ganoon din naman siya. sa totoo lang, mas maluwag pa siya sa ibang mga naging girlfriend ko dati. understanding siya, hindi demanding. kaya mahal na mahal ko siya! ang tinutukoy kong mga rules ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dinedemand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi bat may kasabihan tayo na, ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat. heto ang mga simpleng rules kayat perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila rule . ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, natrauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kayat kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches kahit anong religion, parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng kaopisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kayat nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. kayat kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. rule . hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kayat kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritongpaborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anuano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwangtuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. rule . hindi mahilig magpapicture at magselfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang nakacap at nakalong sleeves na jacket na may hoodie ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan. noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. nirestart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko kinuha ng girlfriend ko yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital, naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suotsuot niya ang favorite tshirt ng nobya ko. napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagmamalfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. rule . huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops!

13729,"AURI, COVID","tandang tanda ko pa last time nagka trangakaso ako. february last year. ngayon kahit sipon or ubo, di ako nagkakaron. kahit siguro may vaccine na yung covid 19, mag mamask parin. noong di pa uso ang mask, at least twice a year ako magkakaron ng trangkaso or ubo."
13730,COVID,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero its not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta also i want to clarify that i didnt post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isnt caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila. we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses whether if its the regular flu or covid. yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito."

13794,X,"naglipana na ang mga ibat ibang animal shelters online, and i think its a good thing since its a worthy cause. they post pictures of their beloved rescues, may it be dogs or cats. some even make memes out of them, but sometimes i cant help but notice that some are using them to their advantage. magpopost sila ng picture ng rescue nila na mukhang nakakakaawa tas magcacaption na magdonate na kayo, ubos na yung cat food ko rescue. pwede rin yung picture kung saan kita halos lahat na rescues na pinapakain tas ang caption ito na ang huling araw na may pagkain sila, baka pwede kayo magdonate para makabili at makakain sila bukas. or simply, wala nang pagkain ang mga rescues namin, pwede kayo magdonate ng 200 para sa isang can ng cat food or pwede niyo rin ipadala sa aming bahay insert address. para bagang responsibilidad ng kanilang followers or donators na buhayin yung mga rescues nila. i get it, mahal magpakain at bumuhay ng mga rescues, pero sana magrescue lang sila hanggat sa makakaya ng kanilang bulsa. paano na laamang kung bumaba ang engagements at donations nila to the point na hindi na sustainable yung pagpapatakbo ng shelter? hindi rin imposible na magsara yung shelter at yung mga rescues nila ay mapunta lang sa city pound to be killed. buti man lang kung maraming nagaadopt eh kakaunti na nga lang tas dadagdagan pa nila yung mga rescues para makapaglimos na naman sila ulit sa mga followers nila. hindi ba animal cruelty rin yung paggamit sa kanila para magkaroon ng awa effect sa mga followers nila and minsan lowkey guilttripping para magdonate sa mga rescues nila? im not saying na bawal na magsolicit ng donations yung mga shelters kaso yung iba hindi na rin sumasapat yung donations bukod doon sa nilalabas na pera ng mga rescuers. yung ibang shelters nga personal account nila ang ginagamit para sa mga donations kaya mahirap din magkaroon ng transparency and accountability kasi sa bank secrecy laws ng ating bansa, in contrast, sa mga ngo e.g. paws or foundations na may sariling bank account nila. hindi ko naman sinasabi na lahat sila ay illintentioned but i think every donator intends to know if their donations are really going to the rescues and hindi sila naneneglect because its going to rescuers instead. whats your take on this?"

na trabaho at maramirami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makakakuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nagaapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapagkunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapagtibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting techknowledge, at may kakayahang magtrabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nagaapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napakagandang offer kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho. sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 95 am para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nagtrabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok 0900 am 0500 pm am at may isang araw na night shift 0900 pm 0500 am respectively. sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman magcause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pagsusuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala nya ang sarili nya bilang si andrew bago nya ako tulungang magfill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan nya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagtatrabaho na nakaupo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang naglalakad kami sa tila bagay walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakakabahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na nakatuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong coworkers na tila nagsasabi na hindi ka nababagay dito. nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na nakapatong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ahhh... anong nangyari... sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. pasensya ka na. sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ah... aya. dapat matagal na tong nalinis. kailangan kong makausap ang custodian. ok lang yun, sagot ko. puwede ko namang punasan na lang yan, wala namang problema. medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring imonitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required magbigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinakialaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi sya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nagbreak para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makakakuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agadagad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at selfconscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako makarating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buonglakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero yung overall appearance ng lalaking nakahooding pangasar na yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga kaedad ko sya pero hindi man lang sya nahiya o natinag sa pagkakatitig nya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagkabwisit at inis. isang kakilakilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang nakatitig sa parteng bukongbukong ng aking mga paa at dahandahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon nya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig nya sa akin ang tinitigyawat nyang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong halfused notebook mula sa nakaraang nagtatrabaho sa mesa ko. hindi nya nilagay ang first name nya, kundi initial lang at last name j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin sya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan nyang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pinaikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easytoundertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakakalitong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong nya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nagexplore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang topnotch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na yun. ansabe. tsaka, medyo butas na rin yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit makatao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na magkakaiba ang edad at lalaki na nakaupo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay nakatitig na direkta sa akin. panget na araw? tugon ng isang pangasar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkakatitig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinagmulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa nakahoodie na walanghiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. siguro marami ka ng experience? sambit pa nito sa nakakaasar na tono at mayunting pagtaas ng kilay. para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?. ano to, highschool? sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa tong 80s na highschool drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo. nagpatuloy ako habang ineenjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga coworkers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawakhawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako makaupo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number you have quite an attitude, dont you? nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prinoproseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, nakatanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubothubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay yang picture sa hr? sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pareparehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang katrabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga katrabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang narealize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpakalunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para makasurvive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa arawaraw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but theres no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nagsend ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakakagagong texts at facetoface na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at wag na wag kang matutulog. walang sino man ang dapat makapasok. panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. sa kahit anong sitwasyon. icheck ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang icheck ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. laging magopen ng skype na nakaready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. panatilihing updated sa kaibiganpamilyalover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 25 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para makatawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga nakaoutlined sa guide ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro yung listahan ay satirical? ewan ko. siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong coldblooded na coworkers? pero yung isip ko nagtatrabaho ng sobrasobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pagiingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na yun, last day ng training ko. andrew, dahandahan akong lumapit sa kanya. puwede ba magtanong? sure thing, sagot nya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para macover yung sixday rotation cycle? kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol dyan. most likely nakakalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman yun sa ganoong kaso, sagot nya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na yun matapos syang bumalik sa final tasks nya para sa linggong iyon. meron bang ibang agent na nagtrabaho dito liban sa akin? pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nagfill out ng notebook na sya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian, ani ni andrew, habang nakatitig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na sya sa pagtatype o paggalaw ng mouse. wari ko ay nakatitig lang sya sa iisang spot sa monitor nya. andrew, nagsalubong ang mga kilay ko. sino yung nagtrabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakakainis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok? tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para idescribe ang pagkakakulot ng nasabing lalake. ah... si michael, sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba nya? hindi sagot ko, pero sa isipisip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. have a good weekend, andrew ikaw din, sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na yun ay binabalikbalikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable sya nung nabanggit ko yung babaeng nagtrabaho bago ako. may nagreklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pupuwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit sya umalis? napakadaming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pagsagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dosedosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglologout na ako, nakatanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapaghintay na mag night shift ka seryoso?! ito ang kaunaunahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agadagad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko sya sa pagsesend ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala sya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na nakalagay sa profile nila halos kakaunti lang talaga sila. nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list nya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nagsend ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nagpapakilala at tinanong ko sya kung hinarass ba sya ng isa nyang katrabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nagcheck ako ng linkedin halos pagkagising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapaghanda sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makakagala at maeenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nagtatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa naguumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay untiunting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabaysabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginalagala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. nakabukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para syang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nanggagaling. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan nya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa di kalayuan. kahit magisa lang ako, lagi kong dinodouble at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong nakaiwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at nakaon ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakakatakot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, di ba? di ba?! para makasiguro, hinalughog ko ang office para makasiguro na magisa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkakadikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako kaswerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaayaaya kong mga coworkers. matapos ko macheck ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. untiunti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napagtanto na napasarap ata ang tastetesting ko sa mga cookies sa halip na maghanap ng mga kahinahinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kakakain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas sya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko na kinakailangan daladala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nageenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prinoproseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahandahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahandahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako makasagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagkaputol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong nakapatay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. laging magopen ng skype na nakaready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay untiunti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang iunlock, pero yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipaglaro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agadagad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako magisa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. untiunti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa nakalimutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pagtakas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong makakuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinullup ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nagdial ng 911, habang nakaloudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agadagad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanaisnais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukongbukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpupumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pagdating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako katanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. icheck ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang icheck ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agadagad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat sya para icheck ang office. wala namang nakalabasmasok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pagiisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. mayamaya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nagradyo at isaisa may mga boses na nagpapapalitpalit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nagescalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litonglito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para ikuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba? tanong ng isang nakakatandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. ah. ah... oo. pautalutal kong sagot sa kanya. naniniwala akong meron. nagpapanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, sabi ko, habang tila bagay nawawalan ako ng abilidad na magisip ng tama. at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sayo ay si michael villareal? sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala yung pangalan nya. wala syang badge. hindi ko alam buong pangalan nya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable. at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong magdial ng 911? tanong ni manlapig sa ikaapat na pagkakataon sa gabing yun. may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukongbukong, actually. nangyari yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pinatawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong. sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulitulit at paikotikot na pagtatanong. si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinangyarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office? tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. hi.. hi.. hindi, pabulong akong nagsalita, hindi ko maintindihan, sinaksak sya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan nya ay balot ng dalawamputtatlong saksak, paliwanag ni manlapig. at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan, may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo, dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo nat ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps, pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon syang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka nya habang papatakas ka. ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano sya namatay. dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi sya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. ok lang kung napatay mo sya dahil sa selfdefense, aya. may balak syang masama sayo. hindi, pautalutal kong sagot. pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god. naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nagreport sa kanya galing sa isa nyang coworker, sabi ni manlapig. jennah, bulong ko. kilala mo si miss espiritu? tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. hindi, ako ang pumalit sa lamesa nya at nakuha ko ang notebook nya. dapat sinabi ko na to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at makalipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinakamalapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan nya at sugatan, at gustong magfile ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage nya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan nyang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nagfile sya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos syang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala sya sa trabaho ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital. ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos sya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga coworkers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaayaayang katangian ni michael. pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na nya lahat ng mga isinampa nyang kaso kay michael, sabi ng walang badge na pulis. kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para mainterview namin sya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu. nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nagabot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang bloodspatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring magsubmit ng dna samples para makatulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pinauwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako makatulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan isubmit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay nakalogin pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang nakasanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagrereply na sya sa akin. dont worry, sis. i took care of it."

13799,X,"so recently lumipat nga ang pba sa a2z which imo is a new low for them. nakakalungkot lang kasi nagkwento nanay ko ng memories niya ng nanonood siya ng purefoods in the late 80searly 90s tas grabe daw yung atmosphere. siguro madami pa ung mga ginebra diehards but the league as a whole really fell off since then, with younger generations choosing uaap and nba over the worlds secondoldest continually functioning basketball league. so if you were a pba exec, how would you try to revive the leagues popularity? matagal ko na gusto geographybased teams sana parang nba, kahit in name only. parang may konting affiliation kahit papaano. though i dont think that will happen easily. another thing id do is make a huge offer to dwight ramos. he could definitely be the face of the league and hes sure to draw a new audience. then id also introduce new rules to try and guarantee younger players more playing time. try and do something about that farm team problem too, idk how though."
13801,X,"this is no hate for the foreigners lmfao, im js saying this cuz this has been getting on my nerves lately, everytime i see a foreigner on the street, some1 will ask for a photo like.. di pa ba kayo naka kita ng white person?? im sorry sa mga ma ooffend lmao, tapos when a foreigner is riding a public vehicle they over charge that person, hindi porket foreigner sila doesnt mean na mayaman sila.. im js saying cuz its been making me mad lol edit tapos yung iba na cacatcall pa specially the attractive ones, i feel bad for them tbh"
13802,X,"let me vent lang kasi sobrang naubos yung pasensya ko sa pamangkin ko kanina. shes 8 years old and sobrang maldita,pampered kasi only child. dinala namin sya ng mama ko sa doctor kasi may lagnat sya at yung mama nya na confine sa hospital kasi may sakit din. anyway doctor gave her meds at ayaw nya inumin, sobrang likot at maldita nya yung kahit tatay nya sinasagot nya. kasi alam nyang sobrang mahal sya kaya di sya kayang pagsabihan ng maayos. nagpipigil lang ako kasi kung ako masusunod matagal ng nakatikim ang batang to sa akin. alam ko tita lang ako kaya its not my right to discipline her but her parents. maldita rin naman ako nung bata ako pero may respeto pa din ako sa magulang ko. napalo ako pero di naman ako lumaking may trauma. naniniwala ako na may lugar ang disiplina at palo sa pagpapalaki ng bata. not to the point na may pasa at trauma pero minsan talaga yung mga bata need nilang ma alala to respect their parents."
13804,X,"kinalmot ako kaso nilagyan ko ng bawang, lakas ng dugo e at deep pa ung scratch, may alam ba kayo kung ano gagawin dito? kinuha rin pala namin ung pusa galing sa kalsada at di kami sure na may rabies ito"
13805,X,may kapitbahay kami na bomba ng bomba ng motor rev ng rev sa engine dahil parang may tago na talyer sila sa bahay concern ko lang is walang pinipiling oras at may kayabangan. sila pa galit kapag nireklamo sila. hindi makapag aral yung mga bata at hindi makatulog sa gabi dahil nagugulat sa tunog ng motor nila. tumawag na kami sa barangay at wala sila tinutulong. pwede ba idemanda nalang namin sila agad?
13807,X,"hello, as the world cup is still going on. the philippines are the only country in southeast asia that is asleep while this wonderful game is taking place. anyway, i believe this community has football fans. this question usually comes to my mind whenever our national basketball team loses to a nonbasketball country. may pagasa ba na magkaroon ng sigla ang football dito sa pilipinas?. sa totoo lang mas may potential tayo na makapasok sa world cup at makahakot ng madaming achievements pagdating sa football. i recently watched a tiktok video about philippine football, and it said that there is no height limit for playing this lovely game, which is correct. if you know lionel messi, you know that he is just 57 tall and that he is one of the finest footballers of this generation. we all know that the average height of a filipino is 54. short football players generally have stronger ballhandling abilities and control. their shorter limbs bring them closer to the ball and offer them better control. anyways lets back to the topic. paano natin mapapasigla ang football dito. ano ang pinaka dahilan maliban sa colonial influence. may pag asa pa ba na sumigla ang sports na ito lalot nakasama ang womens natin sa world cup. yun lang maraming salamat"
13808,X,"magandang araw, mga kaheartbeat! namimiss ko lang yong kontrabando. lalo na yong bagong lipunan segment ni coach mackie. hindi ba natin pwede iurge yong hosts para magkaroon ulit ng kontrabando? since uso na rin ang selfproduced na shows, podcasts, or even video podcasts sa spotify."
13810,X,"was in japan for solo vacation and the most peaceful ive been was when i was in the countryside away from the hustlin and bustlin city. spent my last 10 days of holidays in tokyo and neighbouring places and let me tell you nakakahiya minsan makasalubong ng kapwa pilipino. watched the eras tour movie. may group of filipinos. cinema said regular screening lang and advised to sit back and relax and treat the screening like a normal movie. no dancing or singing as to not interrupt fellow guests. guess what they did? humiyaw. sumigaw. i know the artist encourages people to act like theyre in a concert pero i think common sense na it still depends on where you are and what rules to follow. ang ingay sa queue. filipinos lagi malakas boses bukod sa chinese tourists. i think its common knowledge na japanese people are quiet in public spaces. mahinhin kumbaga. kaya nakakagulat nung kumakain ako sa food court biglang may nanay na sinisigawan at tinatawag yung anak sa kabilang side ng food court good lord nung nasa airport ako pauwi, gusto ko sana kumain. so umupo ako sa kanto ng big table na may high chairs table has 8 seats and yung talagang meant for sharing and usually mga solo people gumagamit. may family of 4 na naglapag ng gamit sa harap at tabi ko. sinakop yung buong lamesa at nagone seat apart. hindi yung 2 sa isang side and 2 sa kabila. 3 nasa isang side and yung isang parent sat sa gitna ng kabila. bukod sa akin, wala nang ibang makakaupo. for context, walang masyadong tao sa food area. and as usual, ang lakas ng boses. uutusan ng dad yung kid tapos pag nasa counter na isisigaw yung habol na utos. may kwentong di ko kababayan to sa sobrang nakakahiya ng actions while travelling rin ba kayo?"
13812,X,"matagal ko na tong sinasabi sa mga tropa ko before pa maging presidente yung berdugo. kaso wala eh, may pagpalit pa sila ng dp nila sa fb showing their support to the old hag. nalaman ko tong golf course nung ako ay nagtrabaho sa isang contractor na may connects sa davao mafia. sabe pa saken ng boss ko, ang simple ng bahay sa harap pero may golf course sa likod. haha. anyway, im happy that the icc narrative is changing. sana makahimas ng rehas si tanda bago siya mamatay. search niyo lang yung wilcon depot matina, davao. hehe. yung may red circle ang bahay ni gago."
13813,X,"hindi ko maintindihan talaga. bakit hindi marunong sila mag basa kahit naka sulat na sa description yung mga detalye? kahit may instructions na din na read tila gusto lahat spspoon feed na yung info kahit may nakasulat na, nakakaubos oras. kahit replyan mo na read description mapagkakamalan ka pang masungit hahaha kahit naka sulat na yung last price magtatanong pa din ano last price mo? sobrang tanga sarap batukan hahaha"
13814,X,"nagsimula ito sa cambridge analytica.... para marefresh tayo sa facebookcambridge analytica scandal mula sa ibat ibang whistle blower, nalaman natin na since 2014, ang cambridge analytica ay nagnenok ng milyong milyong fb profile data. 2nd sa us ang pilipinas sa pinakamalaking data na naharvest. mula sa mga data, gumawaga sila ng tinatawag na social media behavioral profiling ng users. ang sinomang may hawak ng data ay may kakayahang ipredict kung anong isyu ang magpapareact sayo. anong klaseng mensahe at ilang trigger bago ka mag react. kung paano ka aamuin o gagalitin. cambridge analytica will try to pick whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have, and try to warp your perception of whats real around you. christopher wylie ang operasyon ayon sa mga ulat sa us ay centered around deception, false grassroot support, at strategy that borders on electronic brainwashing lumabas din ang investigation ng uk channel 4 news kung saan ang journalist ay nag undercover, nagkunwaring kliyente at inexposed ang taktika ng cambridge analytica kung paano sila nagpapanalo ng kanilang kliyente sa ibat ibang bansa. dito lumabas ang isyu ng fake news, fake videos, misinformation, troll army channels, panunuhol at iba pang dirty tactics. ang whistle blower na si christopher wylie mula sa fb ay nagsabing ang pilipinas di umano ang ginawang petridish or testingan ng ca. dahil sa dami ng fb users sa pinas, haba ng oras na ginugugol ng mga users, at maluwag o kwestyunableng batas, sakto ang pinas upang gawing testingan. ang partner ng ca sa pinas ay ang istrarehiya inc. ang chairman nito, na ayon sa ulat ng rappler ay, taga davao at family friend ni pangulong duterte. maroon ding mga key personality sa kampo ng kampanya ni duterte ang lantad na may kaugnayan sa ca lalo na sa ceo alexander nix. ang ilan ay nagkaroon ng posisyon sa administrasyon matapos ang halalan. yung iba ngayon ay nasa ibang kampo bilang tagakampanya like benayo ng isko camp. ang whistle blower na si britanny kaiser dating empleyado ng ca ang nagsabi ring inugnayan sila noon ng mga marcos para sa rebranding ng pamilya. nuong 2019, bagamat may mangilanngilang news outlet ang nagcover sa scandal na ito, hindi naman pumutok sa masa. ipinagkibit balikat or dinisregard. walang senate inquiry dito sa pilipinas. kung meron mang umalmang mga akademista or intellectual na nag ingay, walang nakaramdam. search did cambridge analytica use filipinos fb data to help duterte win? and why the cambridge anayltica scandal matters to filipino rappler yt at leloy claudio paano tayo nalalason ayon kay alexander nix na ceo ng cambridge analytica at ayon kay pompee lavia ay kanyang impluwensya btw social media director ni pangulong duterte nuong 2016, pagtapos ay itinalagang undersecretary, department of tourism. former sss commissioner. its no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually its all about emotions. the biggest mistake political parties make is that they attempt to win the argument rather than locating the emotional centre of the issue, the concern, and speaking directly to that. halimbawa ay yolanda funds, or juneljunel or meron presidentiable na nagkococcaine. habang nakukuha ng mensahe ang emosyon mo, hindi mahalaga kung ano ang facts or kung meron man. ang tinatawag na discounting cue sa isang mensahe ay mga elementong pampakwela, kamanghamangha o source na kadudaduda para hindi seryosohin ng audience. halimbawa ay tallano gold, or babayaran ni marcos ang utang ng pinas. or mga spliced video na alam mong pinutolputol pero maaliw ka sa panonood. dahil sa scientific at data driven ang kampanya, epektibo ang psychographic segmentation na pagtarget ng mga ito sa audience. sa paulitulit na exposure sa mensahe, na may kasamang discounting cue, sa kalaunan ay magkakaroon ka ng preference toward sa mensahe. ito ang tinatawag na sleeper effect. ang sleeper effect describes the way a message, when paired with some sort of discounting cue, has a delayed impact on the recipient. since 2015 ay nagtatanim na ng sleeper effect ang mga fiddler ng fake news, disinformation, misinformation, trolls at iba pa. ito rin ang dahilan kumbakit hindi maipaliwanag ng isang botante ang kanyang pagkagusto sa isang napiling kandidato. sa tulong ng algorithm ng social media flatform, mas lalo itong nagiging efektibo. kapag bumisita ka sa isang fake news page or group, kahit hindi ka mag react or magcomment, tatandaan ito ng algo. at next time, padadaanin nyang muli ang content ng nasabing page sa atensyon mo. imagine ang snetflix account mo. may mga palabas silang suggested para sayo at may percentage kung gaano ito kamatch sa preferences mo. ganoon din sa social media, at mas hyper once mamihasa ka mag click, magbasa or manood sa mga katulad na page, mas madalas na itong dadaan sa feed mo. and syempre sooner or later, magrereact ka na, or mag syeshare. later on, kapag nagshare or nag post ka na, committed ka na rito. kapag may nag like, react or comment, mas nabavalidate tumataas ang dopamine mo. uulitin mo. halimbawa naman na hindi ka nagsusubscribe sa mga fake news page, pero ang mga friends mo ay nagpopost or nagsheshare, dadaan pa rin ito sa iyong atensyon. habang dumadami sila, nagbabago ang environment mo. hindi mo namamalayan, nagiging normal na sa environment natin ang mensahe. ang behavior. ang paraan nilang mangatwiran. kapag lumaon, kapag may ipepresent sayong opinion na taliwas sa post mo ay mahihirapan ka nang tangapin. denial is real. kapag may magkamaling sumaway or pumuna sayo ng pabalagbag, magkakaroon ka lalo ng resistance. ang kuyog ng mga troll sa comment section ay traumatic. ang dalawang goal nito ay una, para patahimikin ka. pangalawa, para panghinaan ng loob ang sinumang magtatangkang magcomment pa ng pasalungat. dalawa rin ang biktima nito. una, ang nakuyog. pangalawa ang karaniwang user na gumaya sa behavior ng troll. may satisfaction nararamdaman ang mga gumagawa nito na maiuugnay sa sadism. lalo na kapag pumapalag pa ang kadebate. mas masarap diinan at durugin. ang fake news ay hindi kabobohan kundi scientific at kalkuladong galaw ng kalaban. tinatawanan na lang tayo ng orchestrator ng troll farm habang nagmamaktol tayo sa comment section ng rappler. kamakailan, ang whistle blower naman na si frances haugen ay nagsabing mas lalala ang sitwasyon dahil sa algorithm ng mga social media mismo ang magtutulak sa users sa extremes ng kanyang interes. kung nahihilig ka sa kpop or anime, lalo ka nyang ieexpose sa mga ito. kaya malaking peligro ito sa mga depressive at may suicidal tendencies. ganun din sa fake news. kaya naman lalong sumisikat at yumayaman ang mga fake news channels. at dahil sa may pera dito mas darami pa sila. at habang dumarami sila, mas magiging popular. imagine kung gaano ito kaakitakit sa mga politiko. lalo na sa pulitikong walang napatunayan at kapangyarihan ng popularidad lang ang aasahan. imagine ang dami ng financer na mamumuhunan dito kung may control sila sa politiko. theoretically, critical thinking ang depensa sa anumang maling inpormasyon o sa halina ng advertise. pero napakahirap ituro ng critical thinking, lalo na sa highschool. mahirap na nga sa loob ng pamantasan, mas lalo pa sa online class mas lalo pa sa labas. elementary pa lamang ang user ng fb ay babad na ito sa social media. teen ager ang mas babad kesa sa adult na naghahanapbuhay or busy sa gawaing bahay. sila ang pinakaunang maapektuhan ng lason sa social media. right now, we are out class and out gunned ng kalaban. sa us at europeong bansa, kaya nilang ipatawag, imbestigahan, parushan at pagbayarin ang pamunuan ng app. nagbayad ng fine ang fbmeta at nagdeklara ng bankruptcy ang cambridge analytica. natalo si trump nuong sumunod na eleksyon. kahit social media capital of the world daw ang pinas, hindi mangyayari ito dito sa atin. sino tayo kay mark zuckerberg. wala tayong jurisdiction sa kanya ngunit may opisina ang meta sa pinas. bakit walang mga investigation in aid of legislation? maraming dapat pagusapan bakit walang parusa ang fake news? ayon sa policies ng fb we do not remove false news from facebook but we significantly reduce its distribution by showing it lower in news feed. bakit hindi ikinakategoryang fraud ang fake news? kung ang ntc ay iniimbestigahan ang spamming, false advertise at scammer, bakit tila walang kahalintulad nito sa social media? dapat bang gawing criminal offense ang pag gawa at pagpapakalat ng fake news? halimbawa ay medical fake news? economic fake news? batay sa operasyon ng socmed messaging dito sa pinas, maituturing ba itong electronic branwashing? maituturing bang suppression ng malahayang pagpapahayag kung ikicriminalize ang fake news? aminadong hirap tayong sagutin at pagpasyahan ang mga isyung ito ngunit kailangan nating humakot ng mga eksperto, pag usapan, pagdebatehan, magingay sa pambansang entablado. maliban dito, may mga basic, ez at yakang yakang steps sa part ng meta na kung tutuusin ay mapakalaking bagay sa kaayusan social media environment. wag nang sa sabihing social responsibility bakit tila reactive lang ang kayang gawin ng meta laban sa mga fake news at troll farms. meaning kalat na ang fake news, naishare na or na copy. nakapanira or nakapanguto na ito bago lang nila maaaksyonan. ang bawat app ay may logs na tinawatag. mula sa data nito, maaring malamang agadagad in real time, kung may bots na nag ooperate sa platform. halimbawa 1 duplicate account 2 ip ng users kung magkakapareho. kung rehistrado sa isang pribadong kumpanya. 3 geolocation ng ip kung dagsa ang taga ibang bansa or may particular na bansa ang may significant increase sa isang particular na page or post. 4 count ng spam messages sa x length of time 5 at marami pa. sobrang simple lamang nito, sa pamamagitan ng simpleng program na patatakbuhin kahit sa excel or gsheet lang, maaring madetect ang lahat ng ito ng real time, mag auto alert at maari ring maglagay ng sanctions depende sa parameters. siguradong mayroon mas sopistikadong version nito ang isang kumpanyang kasing laki ng meta. ngunit bakit hindi natin maramdaman na inaaksyunan nila ang robotic behavior? bakit wala or hindi hiningian si fbmeta philippines ng statement nuong nagkaroon ng clamor sa mga presidential survey ng mga page? dapat ay magkaroon ng batas upang panagutin ang financer ng troll farms. pero hindi papasa ang batas na ito kung ang gumagawa ng batas ang syang unang nakikinabang. dapat ding malaman ng publiko ang istratehiya kung paano tayo nalalason. ang lantad na stratehiya ay hindi masyadong epektibo. maliban na lang kung ang adik ka. kahit alam mong masama sayo ay hindi mo napipigilan. at nakakaadik ang social media. ang end game kapag natalo ang mga kandidatong may troll farm, magdadalawangisip nang umulit ang mga financer ng fake news army. imagine kung ang limpaklimpak nilang puhunan ay tinalo lang ng boluntirismo. kapag nanalo ang pamunuang walang utang na loob sa financer ng troll farm, malaki ang tyansang maari nang usigin ang financer at operator nito. kaya kailangang manalo ang boluntirismo upang madiskarir or madiscourage ang mga financer ng troll farms. ang pagkatalo ng boluntirismo ay panalo ng industriya ng public opinion for sale. otherwise, kakailanganin na ng psychological revolution ang bansa."
13817,X,"noong nasa manila ako, ive always dreamt of living in the province because as they say, payapa ang buhay doon. now, here i am, 3 years sa probinsya, at mas gugustuhin ko nalang na bumalik sa manila. hindi totoo yung tulungan ang mga tao dito. kapag bagong lipat ka, they dont give a fck about you, at lalapitan ka lang nila dahil anak ka ni ganito ganyan. nakakairita pakinggan na they only wanna approach you bcs of family name and not bcs they want to get to know you, kaya nakakaanxious makipag kilala sa mga tao. plus, dagdagan mo pa ng mga taong ginawang hanap buhay ang chismis. yes, i understand maraming chismosochismosa sa ncr, pero on my experience, mas malala ang chismisan dito sa probinsya. kahit sarili mong kamag anak harap harapan kang pagchichismisan dahil alam nilang hindi ka gaanong nakakaintindi ng diyalekto nila jokes on them, i get the thought of what they say kaya alam ko kung kailan ako pinag uusapan. and the people here just are outright insensitive. imagine gossiping about a person who committed sword then laughs it off bcs matanda na yung gumawa noon, and when you stand up to call that gossiper out, mas kinampihan pa ng sarili mong mga kamaganak iyong tao na yon. i cannot stand that type of stuff. hindi rin totoong tahimik sa probinsya. mas gugustuhin ko nalang marinig ang noise pollution ng manila kesa sa kaliwatkanang hagulgol ng mga batang hindi man lang masaway ng mga magulang nila. dagdagan pa ng mga taong kung makipag usap ay parang nasa malayo ang kausap nila kahit kaharap lang nila. scam rin ang sinasabi ng iba na presko sa probinsya. sure, presko sa mountainous areas like baguio or laguna, pero if you live in flatbed areas like pampanga or bulacan? its straight up hell. kakaunti nalang ang mga puno, at kahit mapa nasa loob o labas ka man ng bahay, ramdam na ramdam mo ang malakas na singaw ng araw sa balat mo. for 3 years ive lived in the province, never ko naranasan na payapang manirahan dito for a long period of time. laging may inconvenience at compared nung nakatira pa ako sa manila, its a lot much worse sa probinsya. jusst please, take me back to manila."

13829,X,"my mother consistently gives rave reviews about how convenient one ayala is. were from the south and she works in qc. since naging senior citizen siya, tinatamad na siyang magdrive. she takes the mrt from magallanes station and gets off at quezon ave because her office is a mere five minutes walk from centris. pauwi, sa one ayala na siya sumasakay ng bus or uv express. tunay nga, ang laki ng one ayala and sobrang convenient. i had the opportunity to experience it for myself with a 14month old in tow. i had stuff to take care of in makati last thursday so my husband dropped us off at salcedo before he headed off work. wala kaming yaya for baby, kaming tatlo lang talaga ang team mates kaya lagi kaming magkakasama and we usually drive. last week was an exception because my husband had a meeting he cant miss, and my makati appointment was likewise immovable. after my thing at salcedo, our baby whos in a stroller and i walked to ayala triangle, and then greenbelt, passing through landmark and glorietta, to sm makati. hindi kami nagunderpass, efficient for us yung connecting bridges so hindi hassle. when we got to one ayala from sm makati, i completely understood my moms rave reviews. malamig ang ac, maramirami nang restaurants and shops although mas marami pa rin ang vacant under construction, maluwag ang lalakaran, maluwag ang cr, and malinis! nakapagpalit ako ng diaper ni baby without breaking a sweat. i initially planned sumakay ng uv express pauwii rarely take the bus home back when i still commute because my experience has always been horriblebut 4pm pa ang first trip and it was only 130pm. gusto na rin umuwi ni baby kasi napagod kakatakbo sa loob ng one ayala mall. nagenjoy siya sa luwag haha. nasa gitna yung bus bay ng route namin but hindi hassle tumawid kahit may tinutulak akong stroller. there were pedestrian lanes and may nagmamanage ng traffic flow. walang tumatalon into a moving bus para lang makasakay, and hindi mapanghi. a far cry from the previous bus lane sa likod ng dusit! when we got to our route, nakasakay kami agad ng bus and umalis din kaagad kahit walo lang kaming sakay. hindi siksikan, walang nakatayo! next time well try pumila sa uv terminal. ang lamig din doon, maliwanag, maluwag, may seats, malapit ang malinis na banyo. ibangiba sa pagpila sa parksquare na sobrang init lalo na pag rush hour. may iwata fans nga pero mas nakakalagkit ng feeling. plus, nakatayo sa pila and hindi mo na makita nasaan ang dulo haha. i believe people here have mixed feelings about one ayala, but for moms like me na bitbit ang baby pag umaalis, im sure theyll appreciate the comfort and convenience. sana mamaintain ang one ayala, and ganitong convenience sana ang abutan ng anak ko pag nagcollege na siya para hindi siya tamarin umuwi. and sana mareplicate din sa iba pang areas, and madevelop to make them walkable kahit may kasamang baby, with or without a stroller."

13862,X,"have you ever wondered why, whenever you watch wish concerts, maraming very longhaired women wearing skirts ang umaattend? at minsan parang hindi pasok yung artist sa generation nila ex. 60yo woman watching the juans concert. that is because these entertainment organizers are backed up by a church called mcgi, or popularly known as ang dating daan of eli sorianodaniel razon. to be fair, wala namang problema dito. but little people know that the majority of tickets for these events were forced on members. ibabagsak nila yang mgaoverpriced tickets sa mga chapters nila and they will sell it under the guise of pagsuporta sa gawainpropagation of the gospel. considered sold out yan kapag dinala sa chapter. believe it or not, it comes to a point na may utang ang chapter kapag hindi nila yan naubos. the members, who are mostly poor, will pitch in what they can just to make up for their backlog. worse, kahit binayaran nila yung tickets, hindi sa kanila binibigay. priority raw kasi yung nonchurch member para makapasok. tbh, i dont get this logic. but its somewhere along the lines of para magmukha tayong mabait as a church sa kanila. ang mas malaking problema siguro dito is brainwashed na ang maraming mga members. some of them are willing to be exploited this way. they believe na supporting their socalled messenger of god is their ticket to heaven. btw, this scheme works in other businesses of daniel razon as well kdr adventure camp, daniels coffee, bes house of chicken, etc. i doubt na nagbabayad yan ng tamang taxes. wala naman kasing resibo yung mga transaction kapag within the church ang bentahan. as ordinary people, there is very little we can do to stop this system. but im really hoping some music artists, esp the woke ones, to boycott these event organizers. if you guys want proof of what i just mentioned here, ill try to upload some screenshots ng mga gc in the comment section. i call on other mcgi members to upload as well."

13867,X,"nagkwentuhan kami ni mama ngayon lang tungkol noong tumira pansamantala dito sa bahay namin sina lolo at lola ko sa side ni dad. nagstay sila dito for a while habang nirerenovate yung bahay nila. masaya yung kwentuhan namin kasi naalala ko yung mga pagkain na hinahain sakin ni lola noon tulad nung hilaw na itlog na ihahalo sa mainit na kanin at yung buns na papalamanan ng condensada at asukal. kaso, bigla ako nalungkot nung may iba akong naalala about sa pagstay nila dito sa bahay. naalala ko kasi yung time na nanghihingi ako ng barya kay lola nun, uso kasi nung panahon na yun yung mga video games. halos magmakaawa ako kay lola nun kakahingi ng barya sa kanya. wala kasi si mama nun, nasa kapitbahay namin, nagsusugal. hindi ako binigyan ng barya ni lola nun. ang tanda ko, pagkauwi ni mama nung araw na yun, pinagalitan niya ako dahil sa pangungulit ko kay lola about sa panghingi ng barya. tandangtanda ko yun na sinakal ako ni mama gamit ang panyo. naalala ko kung pano ako hindi makasigaw at makahinga at tumutulo lang yung mga luha ko habang sinasakal ako ni mama. habang tinatype ko to ngayon, naluluha ako. ang bigat sa dibdib. grabe pala trauma at abuse na sinapit ko kay mama."
13869,X,"just had a thought while working that we once had a laughingstock of a president erap. back when memes arent popular, joketime stories abound about erap being that stupid guy who does ridiculously funny things but being able to justify why he did what he did. example sa isang interview, biglang hinawakan ni erap ang dibdib ng nag iinterview. sinampal agad siya ng babaeng reporter at sinigawan si erap na bastos. erap oh bakit? erap voice reporter bakit mo hinawakan dede ko?! erap eh ayan sabi oh press cue laugh track tapos napaisip ako na sa current state of memes and how much we ridicule snortboy and his abundant supply of stupidity, hubris, and just lack of human decency, we may have another erap in our midst. now, who do you think is the better laughingstock between these two? i expect trolls to flock. d update yep. i got a message from redditcare. badge of honor right there dudes."
13870,X,"after the elections, nag basa basa ako ng mga comments sa mga posts at articles tungkol sa martial law, pero kadamihan sa mga comment eh puro moveon ang punto which is sobrang nakakalungkot. i overheard din kanina sa isang usapan ng tricycle driver at nag bebenta ng sisig, 1k daw bigayan sa motorcade ni bbm. ang pumasok sa isip ko, perapera nalang talaga. di mo rin masisisi eh, sa hirap ng buhay ngayon, pero ang isang masakit na thought eh kakalimutan natin ang isang madugo at madilim na parte ng kasaysayan natin para sa pang isang araw hanggang isang linggong panawid gutom. the opposition kung meron pa man, goodluck sen. hontiveros needs to step up. how do we curve at least a decade worth of disinformation?"
13871,X,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcoswith an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolot lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, in a way that i have never felt like in my life. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. its new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 630am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is us. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan first alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan magandat gwapo tayo hanggang magumaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second magingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang redtagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. dont give them anything to work with. third digital buddies system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isat isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if youre not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nagiisa. fourth do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain nothing from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon untiunting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks."

13875,X,"any review for this is veryvery much appreciated. im an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento chairman ngayon ko lang naranasan to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang yon ang lahat ng away magasawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. mayatmaya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sanay wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumaretkapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada namiy naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang akoy tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayoy hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo ngay hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?! sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisinay pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit nya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang nyang kinain ng walang pagaalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang akoy hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nagaabang sakin sa bahay. alex, marahan kong sinabi. bat mo ginawa yun? tumingin lamang sakin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sakin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito samin. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay nya ang isang dayo na nakaaway nya sa kalsada. nangyari to nang kamuntikan nyang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalaway nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas nya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw nya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labingisang beses paulitulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisintoy naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na sya ng konsensya nya, at ang konsensya nya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na to. alam ko kung gano sila kalapit sa isatisa. kaya pano nangyari to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na toy tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sakin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kundi ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan nya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex namay pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang paginom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwartoy kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak koy hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kayay isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryoy masasaktan sya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguroy kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro ngay mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. cecil saan ba ko nagkulang? tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare nyang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din sya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabaysabay ang pagaspas sa harap nya nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha namay tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punaspunasan ng mga panyo. hindi ko pa rin maintindihan, dugtong nya. hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila. tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pagiyak. hindi sila nagaaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo! isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nagaaral pa rin. sigurado akong yun ang dahilan. isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos sya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam nya porket mas malaki ambag ng kapatid nya , alila na sya neto. isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, baka nagbabaitbaitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pagaaral nya. pero galit talaga sya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyangatensyon si joe kahit hindi nyo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi syang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di nyo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan. sa gitna ng mga labing itoy si aling cecil, at ang ideyang untiunting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. siguro, sabi nya. siguro nga. abbie ang pangalan nyay abbie. social worker daw sya. pagpasok nyay agad bumungad sakin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basangbasa na ang kanyang kilikili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. alex? sabi nya habang mayatmayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin nyang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. bakit di mo ikwento muna sakin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito? pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hindinghindi ko rin masasabi sayo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kundi ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nitoy pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na itoy nagsabi sakin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg nya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na sya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay namay namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin nya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salosalo namin. alex? muling tawag ni abbie. gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hindinghindi ko to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay nyo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong itoy napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayoy nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sakin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibigsabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko tong isang batang babae at ang tatay nyang abusado. tatay nyang lasinggero. tatay nyang isang beses syang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang yon, at tataytatayan nya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam nya isang gabiy papatayin na lang sya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla syang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib. kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin sya ng tao. ilan taon nyang dinibdib yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin nya ang mga kamay ng tatay nya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago nya matanggap ang ginawa nya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaanoy kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi. para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga matay bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakontekonte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo. bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko sya. alex? kuya wag kang lumayo! alex? kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! sige, ayusin na natin pagalis mo. at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. alex? hindi ko rin alam hindi ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin nyo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya! lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit gano kalabo ang aking mga matay kitangkita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya."

13877,X,"i agree 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang like bitch may utak ako and im in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tldr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa? magulang o anak?"
13878,X,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nagiwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking alaala ang nakaraan. mailene! saway sakin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita? nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. of course not! mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha? idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sanay magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang. wait a bit. bumili lang ng ice cream napailing ako at napangiti ng malapad ng makita ang isang batang napakaganda sa di kalayuan. mom! sigaw ni ruine ng makita niya ako dahilan upang mapangiti ako. hi baby. hows your day? tanong ko at humalik ako sa kanyang pisngi at inayos ang kanyang tali sa buhok. super duper good, mom! may tumikhim saking likuran kaya lumingon ako rito ooohhh and tito alex bought me a rabbit napabagsak ang tingin ko sa cage na hawak ni alex at nakita ang isang kulay brown na rabbit. alex naman. nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo. sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is rons bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng mama, siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan. napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya. pasensya na mai ngiting malungkot sakin ni alex ngunit di na ako tumugon. tumingin ako sa labas ng bintana habang dinarama ko ang singsing sa aking palasingsingan. i promise, ikaw at ikaw lang sa buhay ko mailene. pangako ni ron sa akin at isinuot sa akin ang singsing na napili niya. di pa nga ako nagsasabi ng yes eh! maktol ko rito pero nangingiti dahil parang sasabog ang puso ko. mahal, di mo man sabihin. alam ko, ramdam ko. pero magtatanong na lang ako ulit ha? napakagat ako ng labi ng pumunta siya sa aking likuran. papalubog na ang araw, nakatanaw sa karagatan. nagulat ako ng may naramdaman akong malamig sa aking leeg kasabay ng pagpatak ng luha ko ng may mga lobong paangat at nakasabit rito ang mga salitang... will you marry me, mailene? ikinabit niya sa leeg ko ang kwintas at iniharap niya ako sa kanya. yes, i will marry you ron. sagot ko sa pagitan ng aking hikbi dahil sa sobrang saya ng aking nararamdaman. mabalis natapos ang aming maghapon sa batanggas at bumalik na sa manila upang ibalita sa kanila ang plano namin ni ron. magkahawak kamay kami. panakanaka ang tingin niya sa singsing na suot ko. napangiti ako at humarap sa kanya. mahal, may surprise ako sayo. haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at ngumiti. what is it hmm? sumulyap siya sakin at hinalikan ang aking kamay. i will tell you late hindi ko na natapos ang aking sasabihin ng makaramdam ako ng hapdi sa aking buong katawan, nakakabingi ang ingay, sobrang labo ng paligid, hindi ko makita si ron, hindi ko maramdaman ang aking katawan. napahawak ako sa aking tyan. no, please no. pinilit kong imulat ang aking mata at natanaw ko si ron sa gitna ng kalsada ron! sigaw ko rito pero hindi ko marinig ang boses ko. ron, please! sigaw ko pero hindi siya gumagalaw. ron! nanghihina kong sigaw hanggang sa tuluyan na akong kainin ng kadiliman."
13879,X,"it is exhausting and emotionally draining, i know. okay let me dump all my thoughts here for all of the pinks who wish to turn the tide. intensify content creation. we are doing decently on facebook and just need to keep on going. share caravan moments, debate highlights, anecdotes, pink tiktoks, etc. on tiktok we are doing fine but still not enough, so i am pleading to the pink tiktokers to vigorously combat the algorithm. on youtube, we are losing. compare the amount of pink content to the myriad of fringe conspiracies and fake news propagated with its clickbait and oftentimes tacky thumbnails and titles on the site, it is tough. dahil mas matrabaho ang gumawa ng 3 min yt content kaysa mga 1 min average tiktoks. continue the show of force. if you can go to a caravan near you, go with safety in mind. always challenge the bandwagon. we are a race of sore losers kaya mahilig tayong tumaya sa mananalo at matindi magreact pag hindi. beauty contests, basketball, boxing, you name some event that involves a ton of pride. stay unbothered and be yourself in these caravans. utilize the fomo feeling to break the bandwagon by having fun while being a civic participant. take surveys as it is, snapshots. not implying causation here, but survey releases often coincides with the victories of the pink camp. never dismiss the survey without checking its credibility and time frame and learning what we can from the results. this is a psych war, given how many of us are emotionally invested with making our candidate emerge as the winner. kaya when these results come to rain on our parade, bend but never break. begin engaging on the ground with common unities. the elections are very polarizing and we lose the listener kapag nauna agad yung personality. be a calm, collected, respectful, listener when we engage with nonsupporters. ask them ano ba ang hinahanap nila sa lider, ano yung mga issue na gusto mong pagtuunan ng kandidato, and then proceed kung may plano ba yung napipisil niya. use the clearbook method if you will. we know napakahirap magconvert ng bbm to leni, but possible siya with persistence. however, if you can sense the misogyny, use that to our advantage its wrong i know, but again its a psych war din by shifting them away from bbm to isko. when online, know your battles. unlike sa ground, mas capable tayo of behaving badly due to the anonymity. stay on the line of reason and truth. trolls can be either extremely rabid threats or extremely passive i was a leni eme but now i am bbm. ilugar ang approach sa mga ito but never shame them kahit repleksyon ng moralidad ang kanilang choice. very misplaced ang anger nila, thus the boogeyman dilawan and the redtagging tendency. never use academic credentials to immediately dismiss the other. masakit masabihan ka ng mali dahil ugali natin ay may tendency maging mapagmataas. feel free to add more here."
13880,X,"woke up this morning to endless messages asking how we are. its honestly quite difficult to look for the right words without the risk of being misinterpreted but heres an attempt. totoong masakit at mahirap maunawaan but i dont think it compares to the heartbreak we felt when we lost our dad. even then, we had to soldier on dahil maraming umaasa at may mga laban na kailangang ilaban. hindi nawala ang sakit pero mas lalong hindi nawala ang pagmamahal. kaya nagpatuloy. this crossed my mind throughout the day, as i tried to make sense of what has happened so far and as i navigated my way through a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. one of my favorite professors from college once told me, if you want to save the world, you have to absorb all its pain. hindi puwedeng walang aray. theres grief that sows unproductive anger, but theres a kind that reminds you of how fiercely you cared and that propels you to love and try harder. i see it in mama. i see it in my sisters. thats why im at peace and thats how i also know well all be alright. kaya anuman ang maging resulta at anuman ang mangyari, taas noo. hindi dapat ikahiya ang isang pusong pagod at sugatan. ipamalas ang pinagdaanan at ipagmalaki ang lahat ng nasaksikahan. walang sayang. kapit. nagsisimula palang. alam kong mahirap. if hindi pa talaga kaya, then please do take care of yourselves first. thats a very valid thing to do. pero gaya nga ng sabi ng adviser ko noong high school you dont love until it starts to hurt. you love until it stops hurting. ang superficial basahin noh? na bubullshitan din ako minsan diyan hahahah martyr lang yung peg. na bwibwiset ako tuwing na aalala ko yan everytime galit ako sa mga tao pero putangina parang yan talaga ang dapat gawin para tayo lahat yung panalo sa huli. ps. hanggang ngayon nahihirap padin akong e fully comprehend yung quote ni adviser. i dont know how that can be or why it should be that way, pero sige lang, push lang natin yung pag try edit btw yung quote para sakin is only for the greater good. yung pang general lang? para sa bayan lng kumbaga. kung napaka toxic na ng partner or friends or even relatives then putangina iwanan niyo na po hahahaha"

13885,X,"ang hirap din pala na lumaki sa pamilya na hinahayaan ka lang. nung elementary ako nag aaral lang talaga or ginugusto ko lang masama sa honor dahil gusto ng nanay ko yun. sinasabi lang ng nanay ko na okay lang daw kahit hindi pero yung totoo sobrang sumasama loob nya pag bumababa grades ko. samin kasing mag kakapatid ako lang yung honor student simula elementary. naaalala ko sumasali akong mga extra curricular kasi gusto ng nanay ko yun. basta gusto nya yung ginagawa ko di ko kailangan mag sabi. naalala ko nun gusto kong sumali sa music club kasi nag aaral silang tumugtog ng mga instruments di lang pag kanta. wala naman akong talent sa pag kanta kaya instruments lang gusto ko, bata palang ako gusto kong tumugtog. sabi ko pa nun pag nag 1st ako piano yung gift nila. sabi nila oo. college nako yung piano ko wala padin hahahaha. hinahayaan nila kong gawin yung mga gusto nilang ipagawa sakin pero yung gusto ko di ko magawa. everytime na may competition ako pag uwi ko galing school hindi nila ko pinagagawa ng gawaing bahay dun lang ako sa kwarto mag review lang daw ako. lagi yun, di nila alam pag nasa kwarto ako umiiyak lang ako madalas kasi sa school buong araw nag rereview lang ako pag uwi ganon ulit. sa isip isip ko di nyo bako iask if kamusta ko, okay ba ko. kamusta yung pag rereview ko. pinaka masakit pa tuwing may competition ako sasabihin ko lang yung araw kailan then bibigyan lang nila kong allowance yun na yun. wala bang ibang support akong makukuha. di nila ko sinasamahan yung mga kasama ko may parents, ako sagot ko lang may work po. laging teacher kasama ko tapos uuwi ako di nila ko tatanungin anong nangyari sa laban. no one knows if i win or not. then nagugulat sila pag nag congrats mga teacher ko sa kanila dahil nanalo ko sa competion. high school nag aral akong tumugtog ng guitar pero pinigilan din nila. paulit ulit lang pag top ako sa class wala akong maririnig sa kanila pag bumaba yung grades nagagalit sila. di nila nalalaman anong nangyayari sakin. gusto kong mag aral ng instrument at mag paint di ko magawa kasi di nila ko isusupport dun. wala akong masabihan nahihirapan na ko mag aral. wala akong masabihan na nagkaka anxiety and panic attack ako. wala silang alam sakin at hindi nila gustong alamin yun. hinahayaan lang nila ko na parang hangin. ang hirap pala, naiingit sakin mga kapatid ko kasi daw nagagawa ko daw yung gusto ko ha ha ha. samantalang sila need padaw nila mag paalam at magsabi kay nanay. sila nga tong may emotional support lagi. lagi silang kinakausap ni nanay para alamin anong nararamdaman nila. last year mag isa kong nakatira sa bahay namin. i celebrate my birthday on my own. no one checks me. i got sick, walang naka alam. buti pa yung mga tita, tito and pinsan ko sinisilip ako sa bahay at kinakamusta kasi takot na baka mapano ako wala akong kasama. pero mga kapatid nung nasa ibang bansa kasama yung tita ko at nag work sa ibang lugar every day kinakamusta. tapos pag may sakit sila tinatawagan ako ng parents ko para alagaan sila pero ako, ako pa yung bumibili ng gamot ko kahit nilalagnat na ko. tatawag yung parents ko sakin para kamustahin mga kapatid ko. pangalawa ako sa pinaka bata samin pero need ko alagaan yung 4 kong kapatid. never sa bahay ko na natanong nila ko kung kamusta ko. kahit iyun lang hindi ko natanggap. sa mata ng ibang tao ang perfect kong anak. may anak kang achiever at masunurin pero di nila alam na ginagawa ko lang yung kasi wala akong worth sa pamilya namin. parang throphy pinagmamalaki sa ibang tao pero hindi naman pinapansin pag di pinansin ng iba. yung tingin nila sakin independent kasi kayang ko gawin yung mga bagay ng walang tulong ng iba pero di nila alam feeling ko kasi left out ako and excluded ako sa family kaya ginagawa ko yun. wala akong kakampi, walang sumusuporta skain ako lang. sinong aasahan ko ako lang hindi. ang hirap.. napapa isip ko kasalan ko ba kaya rin ako nagkaganto?"
13886,X,"i have anal fissure for over a year now. una medyo nakakatakot lang kasi nagulat nalang ako na may dugo sa dumi ko, but it was painless. so it just kept happening, theres a bit of blood outside especially over the tail end of the poop but since it was painless hinayaan ko nalang. napapa kris aquino ako kasi nanlalambot ako pag naiisip ko to hihi. pero isang beses nung nagtubol talaga ako grabe ang sakit, simula noon lahat na ng pagtae ko ang hirap, talagang pagpapawisan at paghahandaan mo ang pagpunta sa cr para makapagipon ng lakas kasi sobrang sakit talaga. the pain would never end there because after i pooped i can never sit straight for hours because of how sore my ahole was. the only thing i could to relax do was lie down straight. after weeks or months there were periods na nagheal and i think it was back to normal relax pooping and i was relieved, but dumating nanaman ung significant na tubol tapos nag recur nanaman yung blood, and i knew from myself that tomorrow is going to be the start of pain. indeed it was. i have not visited any doctor yet, but the first time i saw blood i didnt tell my parents first pero nung naging concerning na sa akin sinabi ko na, kahit alam kong grabe takot nila. i only searched google for everything about my situation. di ko nga sure kung fissure or hemorrhoids eh. shocked tlaga sila, kasi may history ng colon cancer line ni papa, si lola namatay due to that so yon, aside from the pain, there is also the problem of rectal discharge na para bang sinisipon yung pwet lalo na kapag masakit after pooping magdidischarge talaga. so its been weeks now since i have last encountered blood on my poop. nitong mga recent aftermath ng handaan, wala ring blood yay but the pain doesnt end yet. for some reason if i soap my anal area, it stings. i dont know why because i cant see down there pero internal ang fissure dba? so sinearch ko, tumungkol naman sa hemorrhoid wag daw sabunin kasi ma iirritate. ibig sabihin hemorrhoid naman problema ko ngayon, or did i really had both all along? this really changed the game of going to the toilet for me. i can never experience the comfort in comfort room ever again."
13887,X,"kasi inisip ko, baka di pa keri today, so magsisihan pa tayo at magawayaway muna. sali ako at magnneganegahan din ako. heres my wonderful contribution top negatronics ko for today may issue ako sa ibang postscomments na nagiimply believing in google trends pagiging kampante. at mas issue ko pa po yung kampante daw tayo the past few weeks kasi panalo na tayo? talaga guys?! yung mga matatalinong redditors nakakita ng google trends tapos inisip, ay di na ako mag h2h. ay shit, panalo na kami sa 24 kaya di na ako pupuntang rally di na ako nagffact check eto ha. 1 over the past 6 weeks, never lumiit yung dami ng naghh2h. nadagdagan pa kaming mga matatanda doon. at, guys gumagaling na yung mga bata huhuhuhu. im so proud of you. nagpapakilala, at umuupotinatabihan na po nila yung mga tao habang nageexplain at wala nang negative campaigning.. sa rallies ba kamo? lumiliit ba yung mga rally natin?! 2 have you seen our online war? guys di siya perfect ha. pero sumasalo na kaming mga diwa warriors and discorders. nakakaoldest comments din naman kami sa neutral sites, and while baka di pa namin keri yung top relevant comment, yung top 310 ay laban lenikiko naman.. 3 dito kamo sa reddit masyadong high sa pagasa? totoo ba?! eh di bumababa yung number of posts na di talaga kayang iconvert yung tatay ko. i have never at any point felt that we were leading. kahapon lang mga 4 ata yung onthesameday na lenikiko big events dito sa pasig. usually 2 lang na sityo yung pinupuntahan namin per day pero naka5 kami kahapon dahil sa pausong tropasada na yan, ang itimitim ko na . bawal magtanong tungkol sa pulse asia? bawal idoubt? acceptaccept lang? heres the thing kailangan siyang idiscuss kasi matalino kayong mga balbon. for example, sa discussions here on reddit, natuturuan tayo na 1 sample size is not the way to discredit pulse asia. true, while a 2.4k2.6k sample is horrible at distinguishing a 1 candidate from a 2 candidate, it is amazing at saying that a 23 point estimate for one candidate is really below a 56 point estimate for another candidate. so move on tayo sa other things about survey companies. tanong tayo on stratified random sampling. tanong tayo on who owns pulse asia. sa discussions on reddit kasi lumalabas yung things like the fact that survey companies use third party vendors. who owns these naman? pulse asia obviously has a stringent sampling process required na nakadocument yung mga ganito at tinuturo sa mga surveyors, pero nasusundan ba? sop na somebody from the main company does a surprise visit during the process. nagagawa ba ito? surveys are a big weapon during elections so its worth doing this. i dont want to this to be another vplenisayingsorrythatweshouldhaveaddressedmisinformationagainstherearlier or walanamangtrollfarms scenario again. gets ko, with 7 days to may9 right now isnt the time to put effort into this, pero need siyang gawin later, so wag naman tayong maggate keep sa discussions. sabi ni baby ko na ako daw yung nangggatekeep kapag naaasar ako sa mga events sa rockwell or yung mga pabanda sa katipunan for leni na puro atenista. o sige, i get it, even amongst ourselves we need to lift each other up. pero sana wag lang bilibili lang ng leni merchandise although inggit na inggit ako doon sa shiny jersey design so cool bro niyo kaso ang mahal at parang 500 pieces na lang na baller ang mabibili ko para sa mga lenilugaw na bata. siguraduhin niyong nagh2h din kayo or nagddigital warrior din kayo or nagddonate ha. kasi ang layo ng mga yan sa laylayan. o yan, feeling ko tapos na ako sa pagnnega. plug lang ako ng may salubonghatid sumilao farmers sa pasig tomorrow at 8am. sama kayo! sa diwa you can sign up for a bot that will automatically send links on your fb, para click, heartlike article, heartlike friendly comments. super no brainer yung tasks and its not a lot of effort po. sali po kayo! may discord server din po. lastly, may mga h2h or flyering yang mga peoples council niyo for sure meron tomorrow throughout the week. sama na po! o bukas ha, moveon na. siyempre lalaban yung kabila sa psy war. sige masakit, pero laban pa. ipanalo na10 to!"
13888,X,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako makapaniwala at kinilabutan pero nakakaanyaya ang sinasabi. gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na! medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makakabayad na rin ako ng upa at makapamamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nagapply ako kahit medyo nagdalawangisip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makakakuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ikay sumasangayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang magiwan ka ng signature online via esignature na nakalista sa baba at pumunta ka sa redacted eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makakatanggap ka ng 5000 linggolinggo na direkta sa iyong bangko. ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nagreklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nagtatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james. doon ay nagkamayan kami at nagkangitian alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nangangailangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na naghire sa atin dito agadagad para ngayong gabi. edi padala ako mula sa security company sa morge nyo? tanong ko. tama ka. nagtatrabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila magbayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap. sabay kindat. ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito... pagsisimula ko. ahh, yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok. lumapit sya sa akin at sinabing o labas. isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napangiti ito at ang sabi de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at magrelax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na yung kahalili mo. at doon nga ay umalis na sya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically nakaasign sa akin. ito ang sabi sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang magconduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary pati sa crypt. important note kung may katawan man na nakalabas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasaloob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na nakalista sa baba, pero nagdesisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 23 lamesa na puwedeng paglagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nagdesisyon akong unahin na ang pinakaayaw kong lugar yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napakabigat na pinto ng crypt, agadagad ay sinalubong ako ng napakalamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na nakatayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss. sabi ko. tinignan nya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya. sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi nya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumikiskis sa isa pang bakal na nageecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nanggagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at iidlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay untiunti nang nagbabago ang kaninay parang bakal na kumikiskis sa isatisa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang nakauwi na sya sa mga oras na yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nanggagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na yung isang chambers ay nakabukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agadagad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napakalakas na tunog ang halos magpatalon sa buong pagkatao ko. tulong! palabasin nyo ako dito! ang boses ay tila nanggagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. palabasin nyo ako, hindi ako makahinga! paulitulit na pagmamakaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nanggagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong! mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napakabigat at solidong pinto. asan ka?! nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at untiunting inilapit ang tenga para makasiguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middleaged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na biglabigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pagaaply sa trabahong to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules 4. puwede kang magpatugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan bastat hindi ito makakakuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. wag na wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinagmumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahandahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nagsisimula na akong antukin. mayamaya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agadagad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisipisip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may nakasulat pa sa likod 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, wag na wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipagusap sa kanya. paulitulitulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa nakasulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat nakangiti sa akin. alas kwatro y media na at patuloy pa rin sya sa pagkatok. sa mga magtatanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na nakasave pa rin sa note ng

13890,X,"tldr emotionally abusive ofw father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think im moving out because of him tho its also true. i dont know how to tell him that im moving out knowing his tendencies hello, im 23 years old and my father was an ofw for 10 years. i wont go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusivemanipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story. anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then i was immediately proved wrong. on the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 am and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. verbatimly sabi niya lasing tatay mo and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. at first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and thats when i got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto. he kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. eventually he said sisirain ko tong pinto mo and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so i started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didnt stop and confidently said oh sige until he finally opened the door without a key. that alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya. sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag ofw siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then i made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that hes wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 yearsgusto niya magcollege. i ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat. days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, hes acting like nothing happened and that were ok. i mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. until now im still anxious whenever were in the same room so im trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. and lastly tuwing iinom siya around 3 times a week kailangan ko ibarricade yung pinto sa takot. basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin. may nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. pinapalipat na ko next week and i dont know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho its true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason. i dont know what reactions i will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong entitled brat for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but i just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that im moving out"
13891,X,"wala kasi akong alam sa batas nakulong ang tatay ko at ang kapitbahay namin sa laspinas. nagsimula po ito sa baranggay almanza dos, kaninang 830am pumunta ang tatay ko na si michael sa baranggay almanza dos, nagtatanong sya ng update tungkol sa relief goods dahil hanggang ngayon po ay wala pa kaming natatanggap. mga ilang minuto lang, dumating ang kapitbahay namin na si kuya tonyo, para po magtanong din, pero hndi po sila magkasama, magkapitbhay lang sila. nag video po si kuya tonyo ng mga relief goods na nakatambak lamang sa baranggay. nagalit ang mga tao doon, at sinabing bawal daw un. nagtaka nalang ang tatay ko na si michael, dahil nagkagulo na ang mga tao sa likod nya, nakita nya doon si kuya tonyo na kinokompronta ng mga tao sa baranggay dahil video. sabi nalang ni kuya tonyo, ipadelete kay kapitan ang video. dahil wala naman syang masamang pakay doon, gusto lang nya ipakita sa mga tao dito sa amin na may relief goods na doon. napansin ng baranggay na may suot si kuya tonyo na tulfo action shirt na bigay lamang ng kanyang amo. hinanapan sya ng id na kasama sya sa tulfo action, at out of nowhere sinabi nyang nasa bahay. inaamin namin na mali si kuya tonyo doon. mali sya sa sinabi nya, na hndi namin alam kung dahil sa takot o para lamang manindak, hindi namin alam. pagkatapos noon. doon na sila nagalit. at si sinabihang pusasan si kuya tonyo. ang tatay ko na si michael , hindi nila pinusasan. pagkatapos nito lumapit na ang tatay ko na si papa michael kay kapitan. at nagpaalam na uuwi na dahil kailangan nya ipaalam sa pamilya ni kuya tonyo ang nangyari. pumayag na si kap sa pag uwi ng tatay ko. biglang sumabat ung naglilista ng mga pangalan na magkaparehas sila ng address sa quarantine pass. at sinabi kay kap na magkasama ang dalawa khit hindi naman. magkapitbahay silang dalawa pero walang kinalaman ang tatay ko sa ginawa ni kuya tonyo. sinabi ng tatay ko na hindi sila magkasama at nagkataon lang na nagkita sila sa baranggay. hindi sila naniniwala kahit na pati si kuya tonyo ay nagsalitang hindi sila magkasama. pagkatapos nito, sabi ni kap, iposas na silang dalwa sa iisang posas kahit meron social distancing na naka ordinansa ngayon. nag salita ang tatay ko na hindi sya kasama bakit sya ipoposas. habang naka posas sila, napansin ng tatay ko na may nag vivideo sa knyang taga baranggay. vinevideohan sya habang nakaupo at naka posas. isa ito sa mga kinagalit ng tatay ko dahil ang sabi nila bawal magvideo, bakit nila ito ginagawa? pumasok ang lalaking taga baranggay at sinumbong kay kapitana na nagagalit si papa sa knya. mukhang preso ang tatay ko doon kahit wala namang kasalanan. wala syang ginagawa sa inyo. dinala na sila sa precinto sa otso, sa daang hari evia. balik nanaman sa baranggay. nagtatanong sila kung sinong arresting officer, walang masagot ang mga taga baranggay at nag tuturuan pa kung sino sa kanila ang arresting officer. otw sa cityhall, kinuha ang mga gamit nila na importante dahil baka nakawin ng mga preso sa cityhall. doon naramdaman na ng tatay ko na tuloy tuloy na ito sa kulungan kahit wala naman silang kasalanan. pinapunta na sila sa city hall at kinulong. maya maya ay lumapit ang taga baranggay kay kuya tonyo at sinabing tanggalin ang password ng cellphone nya. nandoon ang video ng relief goods. may batas po ba dito na nakalabag sa privacy ni kuya tonyo? pag pasok ng tatay ko sa kulungan, ang tanging word para idescribe ang mga tao doon sabi nya sakin para syang nasa babuyan. alam nya sa sarili nyang hindi sya dapat nandoon dahil wala syang kasalanan. grabe ang galit ko bilang anak. habang nakikinig sa kwento ng tatay ko. nabugbog ang tatay ko sa loob. sinipa sa sikmura at ngayong 8pm kitang kita ko ang pasa sa knyang tyan. isa sa mga preso ay pinapaligo sya, hindi sya pumayag maligo, at sinipa sya bigla sa tyan. walang palag ang tatay ko. wlang kasalanan nilang pinasok sa kulungan. maya maya after almost 1 hr tinawag na si papa, pinapalabas na. ang sabi nila pasalamat ka malakas ka sa kababayan mo. hindi maipaliwanag ni papa kung matutuwa sya. o magagalit. dahil wala naman syang dapat ipagpasalamat dahil wala syang kasalanan. nag signal si kap na pakawalan na daw si kuya tonyo dahil madaming nakiusap na taga dito samin around 8pm. alam nyo ba? kasama si kap sa pagpapa distribute ng relief goods kasi nga naman march 30 na. anong petsa na po? kelan po yan pina distribute ng city hall sa inyo? ngayon hindi namin alam ano na ang nangyari kay kuya tonyo doon. kung nabugbog sya doon? hindi namin alam. hindi namin alam dahil umpisang rason lang ng pagpunta nila sa baranggay ay para sa relief goods na hanggang ngayong march 30 ay hindi pa kami nabbgyan. dilat na ang mata ng mga kapitbahay namin sa gutom. kaya sila na ang pumunta sa baranggay para makita ito. vinedeohan ang relief goods?

nakakatawa kayo. sorry. kung tatanggapin namin ung relief goods na andito. kasi amin yan eh. pondo yan ng bayan. march 30 na kelan ang lock down? nakaka awa. nakaka awa ang tatay ko habang ineexplain ko sa knya kanina ung mga batas na nilabag ng baranggay at ng mga pulis na nagkulong sa knya. pinaliwanag ko kung anong krapatan nya. at ramdam ko sa knya yung pagod sa buong araw na pinaikot ikot sila. sabi lang nya sakin pagkatapos ko magsalita ng mga maling gnawa nila sa knya, wala kasi akong alam sa batas nak. at si kuya tonyo?

13901,COVID,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video with embedded texts went like this storytime covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack . so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl. let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely dont know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic anyone who is symptomatic, we cant mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pangamoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid with rtpcr, it is prudent that we dont place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???. covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do postmortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 25k na rtpcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rtpcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed influencers should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be patola na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too."

13910,X,"think about it in terms of our standard meal, balance ang diet natin. sinigang? paksiw na bangus?tinola? nilaga? menudo? pakbet with tinapa? ginataang kuhol? kung tutuusin, all of those have healthy protein and are packed with good vitamins dahil sa mga gulay. magbawas ka lang ng kanin, and youre good. but what makes it difficult is the people around us. 1. mga fatshamer na kapamilya. yung tipong youre working hard to change yourself, bigla ka pang bibirahin ng wala ka nang pagasa. or you have this mom who love to sabotage your diet. dadaanin ka pa sa pasad girl effect kapag nainis ka dahil pinipilit kang kumain ng marami. or you have this chismosang tita who asked if youre using drugs kasi pumapayat ka bigla. 2. mga maangas sa gym. ewan ko ba bakit ang daming ganito. kapag magaan ang weight mo, pagtatawanan ka. tapos kunwari nagpapahinga, biglang magfeflex sa harap mo. o kaya naman e iiwanan yung bench na puno ng pawis yuck tapos kapag pinapunasan sayo, sasabihan ka pang bakla bakla naman talaga ako pero pura naman, anong kinalaman ng hygiene sa sekswalidad ng tao?. i once encountered this mofo who laughed at me for saying you can still lose weight even if you drink soda. as in everything na magkikita kami sa gym, hes mocking me. five months later, i lost 40lbs. yup, i still drink coke almost everyday 3. yung mga tarantadong driver. mahirap magjog or kahit maglakad man lang kung puro gago ang mga driver. this includes yung mga ginawang parking ang sidewalk. thankfully, i live inside a subdivision now kaya nakakapagjogging ako nang safe. 4. i think we just love being talangka in general. i lost weight, and some people accuse me of using shabu for it? ewan ko kung saan nila nakuha iyon. i myday most of my gym session and even my meal prep. i barely go out of my house ever since the lockdown started, yet they think i can go to some dubious place to do shabu? wuht?"
13911,X,"idk siguro maglalabas lang ako ng sama ng loob. so my mom and my brother has this habit of pagpulot ng stray cats sa kalye and sheltering them. to the point na minsan napupuno na ng strays tong compound namin dahil nagdadala din kasi ng ibang cats yung nga napulot nila. whats worse is ako yung laging nag aalaga sa kanila kasi lagi silang wala, theyre only home in the morning and late night kahit weekends. so ang nangyayari is yung lahat ng responsibilities ng pag aalaga falls on my back since im home most of the time wfh, to the point na kahit may lagnat na ako, mas chinecheck pa nila kung napakain ko na yung nga strays instead of checking how im doing. they are the ones who buy them food yes, but i want to say na di lang enough yung pagbili ng makakain ng mga hayop para maalagaan sila. theyve become invasive of our home, ang dami pa nilang fur na kinakalat and minsan di ko sila macontrol totally sa nga gusto nilang gawin. ive also came to realize na hindi lahat ng strays eh maamo, nakagat na ako once ng isang napulot nila and i had to get anti rabies and anti tetanus shots for them. i dont want to let them go kasi alam kong theyll have it worse if they go back to the streets and pag dinala ko sila sa mga shelters, they would recommend adopting them instead of taking them out of our hands. im just very upset with my situation at this point. any advice will be appreciated."
13912,"AURI, COVID","dami kong kakilala these past few days na sinisipon, inuubo, tapos diretso sa lagnat. ngayon naman, sinisipon na rin tatay ko hahahaha pls covid ba i2ng kumakalat sa amin lang ba nangyayari to o pati sa inyo?"
13914,"PN, AURI","as a father of 3...akala ko expert na ko sa lahat ng sakit ng bata. hindi namin dinadala sa hospital kasi mababa lang naman lagnat at pawala wala pa. hindi sya nag tatae so hindi din dehydrated. we ruled out dengue and amoeba as well. little did we know, our little one is having rsv na pala. common ubot sipon na usong uso ngayon pero sa lungs ang atake and pneumonia agad. hes only 3yrs old, pandemic baby so hindi sanay sa tao.. imagine leaving him alone sa icu surrounded by nurses and doctors he doesnt know.. its heartbreaking. symtoms ang things to look outdo for so you can avoid our mistakes nose flaring tignan ang tyan kung may struggle sa pag hinga if you have o2 finger reader mas okay a simple online consultation with your doctor sana would suffice, antibiotics lang sana sapat na we are self employed so walang hmo, get some one time er use card or something.. or apply for your own hmo kahit sa mga bata lang mag pa flu shot na buong pamilya pag flu season just today, i found out about a colleague who passed away due to rsv pneumonia as well he was younger than me."

13922,"AURI, COVID","were your meds free? anong pakiramdam nyo nung alam nyong covid na, pero di pa lang diagnosed? how did you ride it out? sa mga nagwwfh, nagleave ba kayo or did you continue to wfh? pano kayo tinest uli after 2 weeks, nakuha nyo ba ung results? im a pui pero di ako pinaconfine. kinuha lng nila quarantine pass ko and gave me a number to inform them kung lumalala ako or pag magaling na after 2 weeks. i think di naman to magiging covid na malala, bata pa ko and healthy. im hoping for the best. sinabihan ko yung mga kapitbahay kong malapit para lang they know. hindi ako pumuntang hospital, di rin naman ako nirecommend, kasi baka mas malaki ung chance na maging covid talaga ko dun na bongga. thanks sa mga sasagot. this is the worst sickness ive had. ang sakit ng katawan ko, yung lagnat ko taas baba, wala akong pang amoy, nagchichills ako random times of the day kahit mainit. nakakahinga pa ko pero minsan masikip na. nag iinhale ako ng steam after magpakulo ng tubig and it seems to help. mag isa lang ako, pinauwi ko parents ko sa province nung january pa. good kasi safe sila dun sana, pero bad kasi ako lang nag aalaga sa sarili ko. ang hirap gumalaw. ang nagtatake ng packages na inorder ko ung mabait kong neighbor. plus the effect on mental health, i am terrified af. di ko alam kung mkkta ko pa yung parents ko aftet this, the fear is real. nagwowork pa rin ako pero less meetings and not on call na. i consider myself lucky kasi di ko pa need ng ventilator and may income pa rin na pumapasok. stay safe everyone. god bless!"
13923,X,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video with embedded texts went like this storytime covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack . so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl. let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely dont know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic anyone who is symptomatic, we cant mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pangamoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid with rtpcr, it is prudent that we dont place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???. covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do postmortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 25k na rtpcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rtpcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed influencers should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be patola na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too."

13930,X,"hello, i would just like to ask if is it considered animal abuse kung hinahayaan lang yung dog na nakatali sa labas ng bahay umaraw man o umulan. husky breed na ginawang bantay literal. and may sakit na din yung dog pero di man lang pinapagamot. nasa labas lang talaga siya minsan katabi na yung poops niya and maikli lang tali niya nakakaawa pag inaabot niya yung food niya. im not sure anong klaseng sakit pero dumudugo yung mata niya last time eh. at nilalangaw na rin. maraming naaawa pero walang gustong mangielam or magsumbong. minsan hihilingin mo na lang na sana mawala na yung aso para tapos na paghihirap niya. if it is considered as animal abuse, where can it be reported anonymously? and kung may mag rerescue kaya sa dog? given na meron namang nag mamayari pero walang pake kahit pag sabihan mo. isa pang alarming is may bago silang puppy na husky, ayun nakatali lang din sa labas at ampayat na. baka may maisuggest kayong solution. thank you."

13940,X,"so nagtataka pa rin ako hanggang ngayon, ano ba talaga ang gawain ng mga pulis natin? nagkaroon na ko ng mga apat beses na nangailangan ako ng tulong mula sa kanila 1. nagkaroon ng child abuse case yung kaibigan ko. tumawag ako sa 911. dumating sila nakabdu pa, pero hinayaan na lang ayusin sa baranggay na wala rin namang napala. 2. may nakabangga saking motorista. kahit may dashcam footage ako, kinampihan pa rin nila. pulis pala kasi. 3. may nagscam sakin online. pinadalhan ko ng report ang mga pages ng pnp. ang huling mensahe nila sakin ay tatawagan daw ng cybercrime division nila. wala na ring nangyari. 4. noong pandemic nang manghihingi sana ko ng clearance para umuwi sa probinsya, tinaboy lang ako ng lokal na police station. manghingi raw ako sa labas ng siyudad namin ng permit para makalabas ng maynila. kaya di na ko nanghingi. wala namang checkpoint noong umuwi ako. ngayon tuloy, parang nasasayang lang kasi yung buwis ko tuwing nakakakita ako ng pulis. ano ba talaga ang ginagawa nila? sa pagbabantay, may security guard naman. sa kalsada, may traffic enforcers at lgu naman. sa totoo nga lang, ang pinakadelikadong mga sasakyang nakikita ko sa daan ay yung mga may wangwang na nakakasilaw sa gabi eh. sa mga terorista, may afp naman. sa holdapan, may mga tambay namang tutulong sayo. kapag may sunog, tulog din naman yung mga bumbero namin dito. sa mga problemang baranggay, ibabato lang din naman nila sa mga tanod, na ibabato lang din sa mga kapitbahay mo. naririnig ko nga rin sa mga nakakausap kong nagaapply noon ay kailangan mo rin ng lagay para lang makapasok eh. noong pumunta kami rati sa ncr base ng pnp para sa rotc, parang mas malala pa sa gubat yung base nila parang wala silang pakialam. sa ganitong lagay, parang ang trabaho lang nilay gumawa ng police report para sa insurance claim eh. sayang naman binabayaran ko sa bir kung mga insurance agent lang pala tong mga to na may helicopter at baril. napakarami na nating utang sa bansa. bakit di na lang natin wakasin yung pnp para makadagdag sa pondo? edit found an article that encapsulates how terrible the pnp is and how even reforms wouldnt be enough to save it."

13952,X,"i know hindi pa november but this is totally wicked! my lola was diagnosed with early stage of dementia when she was on her late 80s. so, the only person na naaalala lang niya is my uncle which is her favorite son. pero if someone will approach her, kelangan magpakilala pa kami and from there lang niya maaalala. our house is a 2 storey, 1970s design like kahoy sa taas and concrete naman sa baba. so, obviously, lumang house na to. one day umuwi cousin ko from work. yung room ni lola facing the front lawn, garage and gate. may bakod na naka extend sa main bakod ng property and gate namin na nag seseparate sa lawn and sa garage. medyo makapal yung bakod and anyone can walk and sit there. nakaugalian na ni lola na to check pag may pumapasok sa gate namin and constantly reminding them to lock the gate. past 12mn when my lola heard na may nag open ng gate and yun na nga yung pinsan ko. then she told my cousin na to close the gate and paalisin na raw yung 2 na babae na nakaupo sa bakod. naloka naman yung pinsan ko kase wala naman tao sa paligid niya lalo na sa bakod. then lola said na ang ingay na raw nila kase gabi na nagtatawanan pa nakakaistorbo sa kapitbahay. my cousin said wala naman tao. then my lola said to my cousin bulag ka ba? nasa harap mo lang oh! nagtatakbo na pinsan ko papasok sa house nila. another same scenario when my uncle arrived and drunk. as usual si lola sumilip and said may tao sa bakod. same thing sabi ng uncle ko wala naman tao but lola insisted na may nakaupo raw. nawala kalasingan ng uncle ko and tumakbo na paloob ng bahay. time came when bedridden na si lola and may nurse na nagbabantay sa kanya. one time nasa room ako ni lola with the nurse and maid then sabi ni lola go out! go out now! loka kami then i asked my lola kung sino pinapalabas niya ng room. she asked kung sino ba raw yung matangkad na lalake sa likod ng nurse na pinapalabas niya kase hindi naman raw siya taga samin. so nagkatinginan kaming 3 and i told lola na kami lang naman yung nasa room. pero she insisted na may isa pang lalake sa room. so the maid and i left the room and yung nurse hinihila kami pabalik ng room kase natatakot na siya. sabi ko kaya mo na yan! another instance when my lola was talking in bisaya like as if may kausap siya. then she asked the nurse to get water for her sister raw. again, the nurse told my lola na silang 2 lang yung nasa room. then nagalit si lola sabi nandito kapatid ko hindi mo ba manlang aalukan ng tubig? that day when lolas sister died din. then the nurse asked kung anong name ng sister niya. my lola gave the name and the nurse just went out of the room and cried. ahe told my mom and uncle about it. clueless na si mom and tito about that. then, nagpunta ng room ni lola si mommy and tito to tell her the news. lola was angry raw kase kausap lang niya at kinamusta siya and all. my mom and uncle cried and thought na baka dinalaw si lola since matagal na silang hindi nagkikita. like nag paalam bago umalis. there was this time rin when lola was talking alone and was saying nanay, tatay, manguli na ta sa probinsya. mag impake lang ko. mat ticket na ta? its as if kausap niya yung parents niya. then sabi ng cousin nila mommy na parang sinusundo na si lola ng mga magulang niya. he was explaining it however, hindi na ako nakikinig sa kanya kase i was lisening to lola. another instance when my friends lola has the same experience. she can see her dead relatives daw na nakapalibot sa bed and was staring at her lang and smiling. i know there are some na may mga stories din like this but this creeps me out super!"

13971,X,"i really need to ask for everyones insightrecommendations in this subreddit kasi hindi ko na talaga alam ang gagawin ko sa sitwasyon namin ngaun. initially kasi, ung kapitbahay namin kinumbinse ang mama ko na may diabetes na magpacheck up sa st. lukes kasi wala daw silang binayaran sa pagpapatingin at opera sa kanya dahil may maxicare sya. ako naman pumayag kasi dependent ko si mama sa hmo ko sa work at malaking tulong nga talaga ung walang babayaran. aside from that, naging masama na talaga ung nararamdaman ni mama at gusto na nya magpatingin dahil may sugat sya sa hinliliit nya sa paa at un ang nagcacause ng panghihina nya. fast forward anduon na kami sa office ng doctor at nung pagkakita nya sa paa ng mama ko, minadali na nya kaming ipa admit ang mama ko note na wala talaga ako masyadong alam about confinement at nataranta na rin ako kaya pumayag na ako ipa admit sya sa st lukes. fast forward ng dalawang araw at naka schedule na si mama for operation sa kanyang paa. kinabukasan ininspect ng surgeon ung paa at merong parts na naging necrotic. minessage ako ng pinsan ko kasi nalaman nya ung nangyari kay mama at ininform ko sa kanya na may confidence pa nga na wala naman kaming babayaran kasi may hmo si mama pero inutusan nya ako na magparunning bill hindi ko nga alam tong term na ito eh dahil wala talaga akong knowledge about hospitalization. inexplain nya na gawin ko daw un or else magugulat na lang ako sa bill namin. kinabukasan dimiretso ako sa billing department ng hospital at nag request ng soa at putangina nagulat ako dahil sa tatlong araw ng pag stay ni mama sa ospital 300k na agad ung bill! natulala ako nun for a good minute at dumiretso ako sa maxicare para magask ng options kung pwede ipaincrease ung limit or kung pwede ipatong ung limit ko sa limit ng mama ko pero negative. fast forward sa 2nd operation ni mama at kinabukasan ininspect ulit at may parts ulit na necrotic at duon na kami binigyan ng option na putulin ung paa nya. ang kinaiinis ko pa dito bakit hindi na lang nila inadvise na iamputate in the first place although ayaw ko naman mangyari un dahil napaka morbid pero sinabi naman nila na ayaw nila mapunta sa pagputol at itry na isave ung paa as much as possible. i get that pero wala kaming financial capacity na sagutin ung bill. ang intention ko lang naman is mapatingin sya at magkaroon ng mabilis na operation na macocover ng hmo nya pero hindi un ang naging case. fast forward sa present, nakausap ko na ung doctor at sinabi ko na nakapagdecide na kami ng mama ko na putulin na lang ung paa nya para hindi na kumalat pa ung impeksyon at dahil 800k na ung tanginang bill namin. kaya ito ako ngaun humihingi ng recommendationadvice kung anong pwedeng gawin in case hindi masolusyunan ng medical assistance sa governmentpoliticians. base sa mga research ko against the law na magdetain ng patients due to non payment. pero ang magiging loophole nila samin ay ang room namin initially ay private kasi ayun ang sabi ng maxicare na covered nila at wala naman sa isip ko na ilagay kami sa ward dahil mahina ang diskarte ko sa hospital. tldr ang ineexpect kong free of charge appoinment sa st. lukes ay napunta sa malaginto na bayarin kaya nanghihingi ako ng advice kung ano pwedeng gawin para hindi makulong ang nanay ko sa ospital dahil wala kami pambayad sa bill. edit nasa ward naman na kami ngaun kaya sana bigyan kami ng consideration despite admitting in a private room initially na inoffer ng maxicare. update nakausap ko na ung sa billing may pinagusapan kaming options. ang ayaw ko lang naman talaga kasi na mangyari eh idetain kami dito sa hospital dahil hindi kami makakabayad in full. payag naman ako sa installment plan pero wala daw ganung option. sinabi ko naman ung storya ko na napaagree lang naman kami sa st lukes dahil inassure ng kapitbahay na wala naman kaming gagastusin and kasi akala ko saglit lang si mama duon at simple lang ung operation pero nagtagal sya at lumobo na ung bill. i expected na macocover lahat ng charges gamit ung hmo ng mama ko pero hindi pala. so ayun tinanong nya sakin na kinonsider ko daw ba na lumipat sa ibang hospital. sinabi ko nasa isip ko naman un pero ano ba ung magiging process? kailangan ba bayaran muna ung bill dito bago malipat? wala syang dinisclose duon kasi ung management nya lang daw ung makakapag decide. so nung narinig ko un medj gumaan ung loob ko dahil parang may loophole. so tinanong ko ano po ba ung magiging repercussions kapag lumipat ako ng hospital at hindi ko mababayaran ung bill sa st lukes which is hindi naman talaga kaya. sabi nya possible na mangyari is maban kami sa st lukes. edi ok lang. wala naman talaga kami mababayad kahit pigain nila kami at kahit anong gagawin nilang pagdetain samin lolobo lang ung amount ng bill na hindi namin mababayaran. kaya kung i restrictban nila kami due to non payment edi go. hindi ko naman ginusto na pumunta sa st lukes balak ko naman talaga is sa pgh or kahit anong government hospital. sadyang nakumbinse lang ng kapitbahay."

13975,X,"na parvo yung 2monthold puppy ko. noong una palang na nagpakita siya ng signs ng pananamlay at pagsusuka, dinala na namin agad sa vet. once naconfirm na positive siya sa parvo naconfine naman siya agad pero mabilis na nagdeteriorate yung health niya. nung andun na siya sa clinic, nagistart na syang magpoops ng dugo. tinanong ko na agad yung vet niya kung anong pwedeng maging option in case mag worsen yung kalagayan niya. kasi tinitignan ko yung liit nyan yun, iniimagine ko palang yung pagdadaanan niya sobrang naiiyak na ako. ngayon inaaffirm nila ako na kakayanin niya naman, kaya nagka hope naman ako na magiimprove yung kalagayan niya. basta iobserve lang daw. hindi naman sa pagiging pessimistic, pero gusto ko lang ding marinig yung isang possibility kahit sobrang sakit niyang isipin. gustong gusto ko syang gumaling i swear. pero kung ang ibig sabihin non e ioobserve siya ng ilang days para tignan kung magworkout yung gamutan niya. titignan kung maka survive siya o hindi. and in case man na makasurvive siya, hindi pa guaranteed na magkakaroon siya ng normal life after parvo. triny kong i brought up ko yung euthanasia, kung legal ba, kung pwede bang maging option. pero parang iniiwasan nilang sagutin. never nila akong binigyan ng exact na sagot. basta iobserve lang at kasi baka naman makasurvive siya. ngayon inoobserve namin si puppy. nakaswero parin siya at nagagamot pero parang hindi siya nagwowork. inoobserve nalang namin kung paano siya mag suffer ng untiunti na syang nanghihina. constant na yung pagsusuka, pagtatae ng dugo, pag ihi niya. sobrang awangawa na ako sa kanya. parang inaantay nalang namin na kusa siyang malagutan ng hininga. sobrang traumatizing at heartbreaking. i feel so helpless. gustonggusto kong iease na yung nararamdaman niya kaso di ko naman alam kung papaano."

13979,X,"gusto ko ibuhos lahat dito dahil narating ko na ang punto na hayaan ang mga tao mismo ang magsindi ng ilaw sa utak ko. i failed upca with a mediocre grade 2.871 na understandable naman considering na i fcked up my grades during hs. i pulled off my application in admu because i was not able to comply with the scholarship requirements course, i cant afford the tuition fee. i applied in la salle during the special application period with a little to no chance for scholarship. to completely annihilate my whole being, the admission office of pup noticed me that i am not qualified to any of their programs. hindi dahil sa may 82 below grades ako. actually, with honors ako nong gr 10 at with high noong gr 11. walang automated email ang pup. pinaresend nila yung grades ko noong gr 11, first and second semesters. hindi ko masend simultaneously dahil iisa lang yung slot na paglalagyan ng scanned copy. the personel noticed me again. this time, with two slots. so i sent the front first sem grades and the back second sem grades. shit happened. upon checking my application form, my gr 10 report card that i sent long time ago was compromised. and then boom. di na ko makalog in sa portal with a very heartshattering notice. ang sakit. i won in debate competitions back in highschool. i clinched a gold medal in journ. i won in a script writing competition. i represented ncr sa youth summit held in dumaguete. i was a former ssg federation president. i was personally invited by the asean youth to moderate one of their most significant workshopsevent in which i interviewed professionals across southeast asia. a lot of teachers and people around me deemed me as an sterling student. at heto ako, umiiyak. nagseself sabotage. walang kasiguraduhan. di alam kung san magpapatuloy. nakakapagod. nakapanlulumo. nanghihina ako sa tuwing dumadaan sa isip ko na ay, kala ko magaling ako?. gusto ko maglaho in this intance. hirap pag pangarap mo yung at stake ano. sa ngayon, hindi ko pa alam. siguro, hinto muna ako para magtrabaho at for more selfimprovement."
13980,X,"okay, this is gonna be a rant. kanina pa ko umiiyak. gusto ko lang ilabas emosyon ko. i just found out the issue about rappler. parang nanghihina katawan ko, ano ba nangyayari sa bansa natin?? i was once a dds, pero yung parents ko at mga relatives dds parin. as in, halos buong barangay namin puro dds. because of that, growing up i was conditioned to believe that all of dutertes critics are just biased towards the dilawans. i always despise all those people because i thought they just dont understand his leadership. i hated rappler, abscbn, journalists like karen davila, up, activists, i also started labeling all those people who got redtagged as npa. when maria ressa recieved her nobel peace prize, i laughedbecause i thought the western world dont know anything about her being biased. i thought she doesnt deserve that medal because shes a bayarang journalist and the freedom of speech in this country is not even at risk. this election has opened my eyes so much. i started seeing the problems in our country more objectively. nakita ko kung paano kabulok yung sistema natin, pati narin yung kamalian at kapalpakan ng administrasyong ito. i saw how duterte made this country so divisive. thats why i rooted for vp leni to win. months ago, i was full of hope. i always look forward to the news updating about her campaign. i even convinced my parents to vote for her kasi hindi pa ako makakaboto kahit nagaaway na kami, pero ayaw parin talaga nila. kaya nung natalo siya umiyak talaga ako. antagal kong makamove on. when june came, i was in my acceptance stage. naisip ko siguro may plano ang diyos, siguro sa loob ng six years magigising yung mga tao at maisip nilang nagkamali sila, o baka siguro makansela yung coc ni 88m at si leni talaga yung uupong presidente. pero ngayon, nakakapanlumo. yesterday, it was announced that marcos jrs dq cases were all dismissed. and now, sec ordered to shut down rappler. whats more heartbreaking is that these past few months i found myself actually enjoying the content i consume from rappler. ive been reading lots of their articlesespecially, their editorials, and also binge watching all their tiktok videos. and then i thought to myself, all those things i said about them were actually the result of being a fanatic towards duterte. they are the ones who are the most critical in this administration, they are also one of those news sites who really provides so much analysis whenever theres a political issue surfacing. just earlier i went to social media, and guess what?? people were celebrating. they said rappler deserves it because of being bias. hindi man lang nila naisip na siguro may paglabag na ito sa kalayaang pamamahayag. their logic is basically, if youre biascriticize our president, then you deserve to be shut down. nakakaputangina yung una abs, ngayon rappler naman. ano ba susunod? i know i dont deserve this kind of government. gusto kong lumaking malayang pinapahayag ang pananalita ko nang hindi natatakot. ano bang kasalanan ko bakit dito pa talaga ako sa impyernong bansa to ipinanganak?! nakakapagod na as you can see, journalists, activists and the opposition were now all demonized because of pdutz. redtagging is everywhere, vloggers who spread fake news are being prioritized, people who critize this administration are harrassed in social media, those covicted politicians from previous admin were freed meanwhile leila de limaa known critic of duterte is still in the prison, and dont forget the militirization of up campuses. as much as i can remember, at the time of pnoy all these things dont even exist despite of many backlash from the people. before, there was this thing called freedom of speech wala na talaga pagasa bansa natin. gusto kong umalis pero wala naman akong pera tapos minor de edad pa. tangina mo duterte!! tangina mo marcos!! tangina nyo 31m!! tangina niyo mga panatiko!! tagina lahat ng mga pulitikong bayaran!! good luck na lang talaga sa six years"
13981,X,"malamang madaming supporter ni leni ang nanghihina kapag nakikita yung survey. parang impossible kasi kung titignan na manlo pa si vp. actually, hindi naman. survey sa history ng presidential election ng bansa, wala pang natalong candidate na may malaking lamang sa survey. ang ibig sabihin ba noon, ay talagang very accurate at very objective at unbias ang mga gumagawa ng survey? hindi! hindi, kasi natin yun masasabi. unless andun tayong lahat at nanonood during the conduct of every survey. pero, bakit napaka accurate magpredict ng mga surveys? ang unang potential nga na rason ay baka nga ito ay accurate, objective at unbias kaya talaga naprepredict niya ang nananalo. pero, ang pangalawang potential na rason ay pwedeng malaking portion ng mga botante ang nacoconvince ng survey na piliin na lang yung may lamang sa survey. this phenomenon could be happening due to different reasons. now, the big difference ng election na ito from previous election is that, yung second potential reason na nabanggit ko sa taas, ay pwedeng mahina ang maging effectiveness nito dahil we are having an election between two solid parties. when i say solid, yung mga supporter ni leni, malamang iboboto pa rin siya kahit pa ang baba na ng results ng survey. yung mga antimarcos, hindi pa rin nila iboboto si jr kahit pa sobrang lamang na niya sa survey. other than that, yung current na lamang sa survey ay kinikilalang corrupt, kahit pa ng mismong mga supporter niya. kaya lumalakas ang ugong na dinadaya yung survey results kasi nga, mandaraya naman na daw si jr sa tanan ng buhay niya. pangatlo, yung pagkapanalo ni duterte noong 2016 ay nagpapatibay ng kagandahan ng automated election. hindi ito pwedeng madaya gamit ang pambrabraso sa mga botante o sa mga balota. kaya naman, mas confident ngayon ang mga supporter ng mga kandidato hindi lamang sa survey na ituloy ang pagboto sa manok nila. to conclude hindi dahil sinasabi sa datos na wala pang natatalong presidential candidate na lumamang sa survey, ay hindi na ito mangyayari. tandaan na ang datos o statistics ay pagaaral lamang ng mga numero ng nakaraan at hindi talaga nito ginagarantiya ang mangyayari sa kasalukuyan o hinaharap. ginagamit lang ito for decisionmaking. kaya, kung supporter ka ni leni, huwag kang manghihina. pwedeng gumawa ng kasaysayan at sa lahat ng mga nangyaring election, ito na marahil ang talagang may mga magagandang rason na basagin ang no mistake streak ng mga surveys."

13990,X,"pa rant lang po, d lang talaga fair sa kung paano na handle ng dookki yung situation at kung san pa kami dinala at napunta. specifically gateway mall 2 branch. franchise daw sila, meaning iba iba may ari ng dookki, hindi iisa, so baka dito lang sa branch na to panget yung food and service. d ko nilalahat yung dookki, eto lang talagang branch na to. hays. p.s. pwede ba ako mag post ng honest food review sa fb ng hindi ako hahabulin ng dookii legally? thank you sa mga sasagot! warning long post may short at long version po, pili na lang kayo kung ano pasok sa time nyo huhu. short version yes short na talaga yan eh brought my parents sa recently opened dookki korean buffet. we were 3. kumain ng 510 minutes. wala nga kaming naubos na isang buong kahit ano. nagreklamo kasi malamig food, wala lasa pagkain, at may mga langaw. imbes na mahanapan ng resolution na both parties agreed to, manager and ownerwhom he talked to on the phone decided to call guards and bring us to gateway admin office instead without informing us. nagmuka kaming eat and run. d nga kami lumabas mismo ng buffet. sumama si manager. dun sa admin office, after they heard both sides, manager offered a resolution. wala pa daw sagot si owner sa phone, pero 1 person na lang daw bayaran. sagot na lang daw nya yung 2 na tao. then we agreed. after going out for a while, returned and retracted his resolution. d daw pumayag owner. ano kaya yun. pwde naman nya d na lang sabihin sa owner na kami yung nagbayad sa part na sasagutin nya kung genuine sya sa sinabi nya before dba. eh ayun d nagkasundo ulit. was escorted next to barangay hall. after barangay heard both sides, they fairly judged that to make both parties happy, we should at least pay half. the bill was 550 each, total of 1650 for 3. so mga 800 na lang babayran namin. but owner manager called again decided to sue us, kasuhan na lang daw kami. mas gusto ni owner magsampa ng kaso na pwede mas malaki pa ilalabas nyang pera sa lawyer, sa papers, etc. , instead of giving any discount. barangay knows that this case was too small and too hassle, and nakakahiya na iakyat pa yung ganitong klaseng kaso sa isang gov. agency 3 letters d ko na matandaan kasi maliit na bagay lang. barangay offered to shoulder half of the payment 800, wag na lang daw ituloy yung kaso. kasi yun nga una, nakakahiya daw, pangalawa, hassle rin kasi maliit na bagay pwede pag usapan. pumayag kami para lang matapos na. 34 hours lumipas , tapos parents ko at ako gutom pa rin. kaya nga dapat d kami pumayag na maglabas ng kahit magkano eh. tsaka magmumuka kaming hindi cooperative kung inayawan pa namin yung half half na settlement. ending owner gets the full amount and wins ayaw talaga kasi asikasuhin ng barangay kasi nakakahiya at hassle talaga para sa maliit na bagay mag sampa ng kaso sa gantong amount and klase. nawalan 800 pesos kasi d naman kami kumain talaga. gutom pa rin kami pagkatapos __ long version bagong bukas yung dooki korean buffet dun sa bagong gateway, so nag plan ako dalin parents ko dun para ma experience namin, we havent tried any other branches yet. pumunta kami ng mga bandang 12pm. nung pakuha na ako ng sarili kong food, may langaw sa makisushi, pero d ko na lang pinansin binugaw ko na lang. so eto yung mga reklamo ko sa food by order of consumption sushimaki cold, below room temperature, hindi lang yung hindi mainit, malamig talaga. matigas yung kanin parang lumang kanin or parang yung sa bahay lang galing na d maganda pagkakasaing. sabi ko baka makabawi sa chicken... malamig rin. mas malapit sa matigas kesa sa malambot. parang nawawalan na ako ng gana. sana masarap naman tong chapchae nila.. malamig walang lasa, literal walang asin or kahit anong flavor akong matikan, noodles na malamig lang. mas may lasa pa yung chapchae ng bon chon tinanong ko parents ko naman kung nag eenjoy ba sila baka ako lang kasi maarte. ayun sabi rin nila hindi masarap food. so mga 10 min lang kami kumain sa table, hindi kasama yung time na paghahanap ng food na mga 1015 minutes. parang wala na rin kasi mapili masyadong food eh. konti lang compared sa ibang buffet, parang d sya considered na buffet sakin. mali ko lang d muna ako umikot sa food, kasi inassume ko na pag buffet marami talaga pagpipilian. so kesa makahanap pa kami ng ibang food para makabawi dun sa mga malalamig na food, wala na masyado pagpipilian talaga. so ayun, kesa sa pilitin namin na ienjoy yung food kahit d naman talaga, nag decide na ako magreklamo, and sana full refund, kasi parang yung kinain naman mga worth 100 lang, tapos yung food na d nagalaw nasa tancha ko mga 200300 pesos lang. pero okay na rin ako sakali kung d pumayag, kahit 1 person na lang bayararan namin. ayun eto na mga ganap. sabi ko sa parents ko wag na sila kumain, then called a manager. we expressed our concerns, na saglit pa lang kami kumakain, na malamig pagkain, etc. umalis saglit, d ko alam san nagpunta. tapos bumalik, sabi nya bawi na lang daw sila next time. ano yun? panong bawi eh ano gagastos ulit kami diun eh ayaw na nga namin kumain ulit dun. tapos pagbabayarin pa kami dun sa kinain naming kokonti? ano kaya yun. sabi ko hindi naman pwede ganun lang. ayun umalis ulit. nung bumalik samin, yung leftover daw d na daw ichacharge samin meaning neto need pa rin namin mag pay ng full amount. eh magkano lang yung charge na yun 250, tsaka babayaran mo lang talag yun kung may tira eh. eh mismong yung pagkain nga d namin gusto kaya naging tira. ayun umalis ulit. kung iisipin, pwede naman ding ang ginawa nya is mag sorry at mag offer ng new food na mainit, pero hindi eh. eto sana pwede nyang sinuggest samin nung una pa lang, kaso mainit na ulo ko nung time na yun kasi d maayos pagkakahandle nung manager, tsaka late ko na naisip, nung nasa barangay hall na kami. oops lumaktaw na ako haha, balik ako sa kwento. bumalik samin, nag spill ng script si manager! halata na medyo kinakabahan, tapos scripted yung sinasabi nya. na parang wala silang magagawa ganun chu chu pero sa english syempre. eh alam naman nila na kakapasok lang rin namin. bakit d magawan ng paraan to? ayun biglang umalis sa kalagitnaan ng script nya, baka may tumawag sa kanya sa labas. so ayun, napansin na namin kaya pala sya umaalis is para tawagan yung boss nya, which is yung mismong owner nung franchise. i learned na franchise lang sila, at hindi iisang big food company, which means hindi iisa may ari, iba iba per franchise. i learned this nung nasa barangay hall na lang rin. nagantay kami ng mga 2030 min, pero wala pa ring sagot pa daw si owner. we suggested to pay at least for 1 person for 550 kahit sa totoo lang hindi aabot ng 200 pesos yung dinala naming food sa table. ang tagal kasi gawan ng paraan naiininip na kami, d naman namin pwede galawin yung pagkain kasi nga syempre nagrereklamo kami sa food. nakatunganga na lang kami bale. ang tagal talaga eh. so ayun sasabihin daw nya sa owner kung pwedeng 1 person na lang bayaran. may napansin mom ko sa buffet, ang daming langaw. sabi ko sa kanya picturan nya in case, kung ayaw nilang pumayag magparefund, pakita na lang natin na may mga langaw food nila. which is totoo naman. kaso nung kukuha na ng picture mom ko, nagsialisan, kaya wala tuloy kaming kuha. ang kuha ko lang is may video ng 12 langaw, pero nasa table lang, d ko lang alam kung pwede magamit sa kanila yun in any case, kung counted pa rin ganun. so nag antay ulit kami. maya maya, napapansin ko na may mga guard na sa labas ng dookki. weird lang kasi medyo marami, mga 35? tapos d lang sa iisang lugar, parang nakakalat sila sa labas. d ko na lang muna pinansin. pero maya maya pinuntahan nakami tapos dinala kami sa mga guard, tsaka lang nya sinabi na sa admin office ng gateway na lang daw namin i settle yung problema. eh para samin, bakit pa idadamay mismong gateway kung kaya naman pag usapan to within the 2 parties? ang lala naman ng ganun, nagmuka tuloy kaming eat and run. d bale kung naka eat nga eh. tsaka kung nag run, mismong d nga kami lumabas ng buffet. sino ba d maiinis? yung pwede pag usapan, pinalala pa at dinamay yung gateway? d ko magets ano nangyayare. ayun, dinala na kami sa admin office, kasama yung manager. pagdating dun sa office, nag explain kami ng sides dun sa admin. may iba ring tao, mga security ata mga 34 sila. sinabi lang rin namin ulit yung reklamo dun sa food ng buffet, at wala kami masyado nakain, etc. sinabi namin dinala na lang kami dito ng d namin alam, na ayun nga d pa nga namin alam feedback ni owner dun sa offer naming payment na 1 na tao. sino ba d maiinis sa ganung outcome eh. maya maya, pagkatapos mag explain both sides, si manager wala pa ring sariling desisyon, labas ulit ng office para tawagan si owner. after a while, bumalik sya, sabi nya wala pa raw reply, pero sasagutin na lang daw nya yung 2 persons para lang matapos yung issue. edi ayun dapat tapos na yung issue, nagsalita na kasi sya eh. pumayag na kami, 550 yung babayaran. wala akong barya, binigay ko 1k. balik na lang daw sya sa dookki para suklian at bigyan kami ng resibo. narinig lahat ng tao dun sa kwarto pati admin at security sa usapan. ayan happy mood na ulit ako kasi tapos na yung problema eh. nakipag kwentuhan na rin kina admin, etc. mabait rin sila kahit mukang nakakatakot, kasi security iba dun eh, nakakaintimidate lang, share lang. so lumipas 20 minutes, ayan nakabalik na rin sya sa wakas. kaso nung pagpasok, parang 1k pa rin hawak nya. ayan na nga. sabi samin, d daw pumayag si owner na sya magbayad, dapat daw kami... kung nasa kanya naman daw, walang problema sagutin nya yung 2 na tao. ahm... eh kung d na lang nya sinabi sa owner na sya yung magbabayad at sinabing kami yung nagbayad para tapos na? parang d naman naging valid at genuine yung pagiging makatao nya sa rason nya. kung nasa kanya? eh kung nasa kanya naman pala, eh di di na lang nya sana sinabi na sya magbabayad, para matapos na. so ano? ang hipokrito naman nun. lumalabas na insincere syang tao. gusto nya lang lumabas na genuine sya, pero d naman siguro halata na nagbago lang isip nya? may nakausap siguro pagbalik nya sa dookki, kaya nagbago isip. eto, d na ulit nagkasundo, sabi ni admin, dalin na daw eto sa barangay. ayun na nga. daming eme. sabi namin sige, ganun lang rin naman mangyayari ulit, kung ano nangyare ngayon. ganun pa rin ganap, pagdating sa barangay hall ng cubao, nag explain both sides. pero ang pinagkaiba lang sa side nila, meron silang picture na nung pagkain namin, na before wala. pinapamuka nila na kung d naman daw kami nag enjoy bakit andaming food sa table. eh malamang kinuha yun nung una pa lang. d naman ibig sabihin nun nag enjoy na agad. tapos kwento 3040 minutes daw kami nandun, kasi may timer daw yung induction stove nila dun sa ginamit namin dun sa soup. nag iba na panig nila, pinapalabas na nila na kumain kami tapos gusto naming tumakbo. hay kaloka. nakakapagod mag kwento ang haba, pero patapos na. paigsiin ko na kasi paulit ulit na yung iba dun sa sinabi namin sa admin office. so ayun, nag intervene ang barangay. para walang away daw, kalahti na lang bayaran namin. pero sinabi namin sa barangay , kahit anong discount ayaw naman bigay ng dookki. tinanong nila ulit si manager para matapos na, ayun. labas ulit. call owner. bumalik. ayaw pa rin daw ng owner. magsasampa na lang daw sila ng kaso... sabi namin sige lang, magsampa kayo ng kaso. alam kasi ni dad na mas mahal pa magagastos nila sa lawyer at sa iba pa, para lang asikasuhin yung kaso para sa 1650, kaya d rin kami natatakot, tsaka sincere naman talaga kami sa reklamo namin, d naman kami eat and run. ayun, medyo nasisiraan na rin ng ulo mga barangay sa side ng dookkii, kasi d man lang mag adjust kahit konti. pero kung gusto daw talaga nila magsampa ng kaso, need daw nila ng spa. si manager daw mag aasikaso nun. by that time, medyo halata na napapagod na si manager, kasi d sya makakilos, wala syang sariling desisyon, tapos d nya na alam gagawin pagdating sa mga legal stuff. eh wala eh sabi sa kanya ng owner nya na magsampa, so wala syang choice talaga. pero sa totoo lang, ayaw rin ipatuloy ng barangay yung kaso, kasi nakakahiya daw i escalate pa daw to dun sa gov ageny na nabanggit, 3 letters yun d ko na maalala sorry d talaga familiar sakin, parang ngayon ko lang narinig. nakakahiya daw kasi maliit na bagay lang tsaka maliit na halaga, na kaya naman daw pag usapan, pero pinaabot pa sa kaso. tingin ko rin medyo may hassle rin sa side nila, d ko lang alam ano mga gagawin nila talaga. masasabihan rin siguro sila na simpleng issue d nila maayos, kaya ayun ayaw nila magkaron ng record. so kesa daw ituloy yung kaso, sabi ng barangay, sagot na daw nila yung kalahati. bayaran na lang daw namin yung 800. para sakin lang, d dapat kami pumayag kasi sa dulo kami panalo eh, kasi mangyayare d rin matutuloy kaso kasi una, oras na magagamit nila, pangalwa, yung gastos nilan sa lawyer, etc. . para magdemanda ng 1650 pesos. pero ayun pumayag na lang rin kami sa half. para tapos na. pumayag kami kasi magaling magsalita yung barangay, persuasive, people person, kaya mapapaoo ka na talaga pag kumontra pa kami dun, lalabas lang rin na ayaw rin namin makipag cooperate ayoko na rin ma stress parents ko. so ano nangyare sa huli nakuha nila full amount, 800 samin, 800 galing barangay gumastos ng 800 para sa food worth 100200 at pinaka nakakainis sa lahat, gutom. pa rin. kami. so kumain na lang kami sa iba. so gastos is 800 500 1300 para sa simpleng pagkain lang. ayun salamat sa pakikinig. nakakainis lang talaga eh. pera is pera. may right naman tayo umayaw sa food kung d naman talaga masarap, at alam mo sa sarili mo na d ka umabuso."
13991,X,"kauuwi ko lang galing megamall with my friend inabot kami ng 1000 kasi kumain pa kami. then, nung nakapila na kami sa carousel nagulat ako kasi in a span of 30 seconds, umabot na agad hanggang hagdan yung pila. grabe dagsa ng commuter. then nagsalita si kuyang nasa harap namin, nv kaunti pa yan, minsan paikot pa yan papuntang footbridge. halos magkahalo na yung southbound at northbound. pero para sa mga minsan lang bumiyahe rito, magugulat talaga. nagulat ako kasi may halong galit si kuya. sinabi niya rin na madadaya mga driver kasi namimili sila ng isasakay. tulad sa case namin na yung nasakyan namin ay hanggang guadalupe lang. karamihan daw sa mga oras na yon, hanggang ayala lang tapos iikot na panorthbound. dinadaya ng mga driver kasi 11pm may bayad na yung carousel. so pagdating ng 11pm, maraming sasakay at magbabayad kasi naipon yung mga commuter. sana raw kahit iextend yung mrt ng 1030pm. kasi sa southbound hanggang 1030pm naman daw. noong hindi pa raw new normal, ok pa raw yung carousel kasi wala pa namang onsite non. pero ngayong meron na, hindi man lang inimprove yung transportation. magtatrabaho ka sa loob ng 9hrs para tapos dagdag mo pa yung biyahe na 35hrs depende pa sa layo ng uuwian mo. hindi ko rin masisisi mga driver bakit nila ginagawa yon. underpaid na rin sila, so kailangan talaga nila humanap ng paraan para kumita ng pera. nabaon na rin sila sa utang. kawawa talaga mga below average income earner sa pilipinas. pilit na pinagtatrabaho onsite dahil masisira daw ekonomiya ng pilipinas kapag work from home. isa sila sa dahilan bakit mauunlad businesses dito sa pilipinas pero sila yung naiipit. kapag naman nagkaroon ng sakuna o bigayan ng ayuda, hindi sila prioritize kasi uunahin yung mga walang trabaho. then may bahid pa ng corruption yon, kaya bawas na or worst wala na talagang dadating sa mga below average income earner. tapos yung gobyerno walang ginagawa about don paparty party na lang. samantalang yung mga taong nagsasakripisyo, hirap na hirap na. sana magising na kayo. 31m magtransform na kayo para may masakyan yung mga commuter."
13992,X,"gusto ko munang linawin na hindi ako communications expert o marketing guru. gusto ko lang mag suggest base sa mga nakikita ko sa socmed, lalo na recently nitong bagyong ulysses. kung lagi kang tambay sa socmed lalo na nung madaling araw na nagbaha sa cagayan, makikita mo talaga na si leni ang nag lead ng response. sya ang nag coordinate sa rescue efforts habang wala kang naririnig sa side nina duterte, nagsalita lang sila kinabukasan na. pero bakit ang dami pa rin nauuto at nag defend sa admin, matapos ng incompetence nila. sabihin na natin marami don ay troll, pero meron rin talagang totoong tao na kakilala mo. ito yun eh the opposition has a messaging and branding problem. kapag nagsalita sila o nag post, ang maaalala mo ay yung bibo mong kaklaseng first honor na ilang taon mong kinainggitan at kinamuhian. katunog nila yung mga laging napupuri ng teacher, hindi mo makita sa kanila yung katulad mong madalas napapagalitan o katulad mong hindi nakapagaral. kung mag post sila, kumpleto ang punctuation, walang jejespeak, correct grammar din lagi. kapag nag post sila ng pictures, masyadong maayos ang kuha, nasa gitna sila na mukang bida, mukang staged, mukang nangangampanya. parang may kasama silang professional photographer. kahit totoong nagtatrabaho sila, mukang palabas lang. si mar roxas noon,kahit ang daming trabahong ginawa noong yolanda, na kuhanan lang na nagtatrapik, nag mukang try hard. samantalang si duterte saglit lang bumisita, nag mura sa kamera, nagmukang awang awa, mukang may puso, mukang flawed katulad mo. si vp leni nagpapicture, pero masyadong photogenic, masyadong mukang masaya. hindi mukang haggard. kung nanay kang hindi na nakakapagayos, posibleng kainggitan mo pa. madaling paniwalaan na ang dami nyang alalay kahit sa totoo wala naman. hindi sya mukang puyat. muka syang matalino, mukang matalino mga anak nya. ikaw mukang magtitinda ng sago o maglalaba. minsan may mga post silang hindi mo ma intindihan, masyado mahaba, o masyadong malalim ang tagalog, parang reaction paper sa filipino. si duterte, mukang tambay, hindi intimidating ang dating sa tao. mukang pwede mong kausapin. kamuka lang ng tatay mo na minsan walang silbi pero mahal naman kayo talaga, o kaya yung kapitbahay mong lasenggo na madalas tambay pero maaasahan mong repairman. si chel diokno, mukang masungit na teacher. hindi sya yung tipong parang pwede mong makakwentuhan. si bam naman, mukang cosplayer ni ninoy. kung hindi mo tutukan yung mga senate hearing, hindi mo malalaman na sya yung pinaka may sense mag tanong sa mga iniimbestigahan, hindi katulad nina pacquiao na laging napapasok yung diyos sa usapan. o yung iba na may bibitawan na mga catchphrase para mabalita. so pano yun, ano na dapat? ang tingin ko, good example e yung socmed manager ni vico sotto. baka pwede na nila pagbasehan. simple ang language pero kapag nag post, nandun pa rin lahat ng mahalagang info. hindi mukang recitation, hindi mukang talumpati. it gets the message across while not sounding intimidating. parang post mo lang, o post ng kaibigan mo. yung mga picture, tamang dami lang, saka hindi sya mukang nangangampanya iniiwasan nila yung mga direct shot na nasa gitna lagi si vico, laging nahagip lang ng kamera habang nakatayo, wala sa aktong nagaabot ng bigas o relief goods. hindi mukang peke, hindi magamit ng mga troll na black propaganda o disinformation material. hindi naman kailangan lumangoy sa basura o magswimming sa baha, pero sana at least magmukang gagawin mo talaga yun kung kailangan. nung sinabi ni duterte na mag jet ski sya, mukang gagawin nya talaga eh. nabenta nya. di ko alam pano tamang gawin pero ganito na yata talaga ang labanan ngayon, kelangan mo ibenta sarili mo eh. hire kayo ng mga marketing consultants please, wag diy. o kung meron na please fire them. please lang natuto na sana kayo sa nangyari kay mar roxas. edit salamat sa mga insightful replies! sana mas maraming ganitong discussions sa sub kesa puro tayo oneliner, punchlines, at memes. linawin ko lang na hindi ito tungkol sa kesyo dds ka o dilawan. ang usapin e bakit walang appeal sa ordinaryong tao ang opposition kung totoong nagtatrabaho naman sila at hindi corrupt. ibang diskusyon pa yung tungkol sa paid trolls at sponsored misinformationdisinformation. hindi ko sinasabi na dapat mag rebrand si leni bilang si ms talipapa or someting. ayusin lang yung language at pictures para huwag ma alienate yung mga botante. ang sana lang wag nila padaliin para sa mga trolls yung trabaho nila. wag mo sila bigyan ng material. kung hindi nagtrapik si mar o kung mas inayos nya yung wording tungkol sa romualdezaquino, baka hindi sya nag mukang masyadong tanga o namumulitika. hindi maging kapanipaniwala na kumain sya ng kanin sa baso o uminom ng tubig sa plato."

13995,X,"and eto yung reply ko sa kanya. i would also like to have some insights from all of you. empathy is the key acquired skill yung empathy and pwede siyang practisin detail shiz na this and some innately have it. kung malalagay mo yung sarili mo sa situation ng ibang tao thats good enough but mas better kung empathy iisipin mo kung pano gagaaan yung situation nila moving forward. it doesnt have to be complicated, pwedeng magstart in small things. like sa food court, nakaugalian ko na na ayusin yung mga natira konaming pagkain sa table, like pinupunasan ko pa yung mesa with tissue. kukunin na lang ng mga cleaners yung tray na organized na. sinasabihan pa ako ni mommy na iwanan mo na yan may magliligpit nyan, hindi ako nakikinig. eh ano ba naman yung ayusin na yung basura kasi kami naman kumain nun, i remember na yung pinagkainan namin sa foodcourt ako pa nagabot kay kuya na cleaners nung tray kasi medyo malayo yung pwesto niya. paalis na kami nun, tinapon ko na sa basurahan yung box, yung tray na lang inabot ko sa kanya, and ako pa nagthank you. its a matter of simple things na hindi man makakaimpact sa kanila pero at least gumaan yung trabaho nila kahit for a second. and that can apply to all aspects of life. from career to relationships, if youre natural giver, mas madali siyang gawin. and its not that you will be a yes man, unhealthy yun, dapat balance lang. walang macocompromise na situation it should be win win for both shoes. mutual help dapat. walang givers, walang takers. yun yung ideal world if lahat ng tao natural empaths. pero since we are just people na sobrang daming flaws, we can just only do so much para sa iba nang hindi mo nalulubog sa baha yung sarili mong sapatos. most of the time, hanggang dun mo lang sila kayang tulungan and thats enough. kumbaga youve done your part. sila na bahala sa the rest. and it doesnt mean na wala ka nang pakialam sa kanila after all. kelangan lang din nilang tulungan yung sarili nila for better. kung may empathy sila kahit papano, maiisip nila na baka hassle na sa kabilang party yung favors and help and its time to give back the favor, not only for you but for others."
13996,X,"hinuli ako ng highway patrol guard for not wearing facemask yung passenger ko at improper wearing of seatbelt daw. what really happen pagkakapasok namin ng express, ibinaba ni passenger yung nakasukbit sa balikat niya na seat belt para kuhain yung pagkain sa likod at tinanggal lang niya kabilang side ng tenga ng mask para kumain pero di totally hinubad. biglang harang samin ng hway patrol guard at violation noong una is improper wearing of belt at not wearing of face mask based daw sa camera nila. eh hindi naman talaga nakahubad totally yung mask that time para sabihin niyang not wearing. nabasa ko naman regarding sa mga puv vehicles rules wear your mask at all times. pero parang unfair ng ginawa sa part kong yun na ang violation is not wearing facemask. tanggapin ko naman kung wala talagang suot pero hindi eh. dapat daw pagkasubo, suotin uli daw yung mask. ngayon dito ako sa laguna at qc ko pa kkuhain yung lisensya. marereklamo ko ba yung mga ganitong situation kasi napakaunfair lang ng nangyari. salamat sa sasagot. ganito ba kawalang ka consideration mga officer natin? note taga laguna ako and sa calax ako nahuli then inissuean akong top at qc main ko pa makukuha daw yung lisensya ko. may chance ba kong icontest tong pangyayari kasi hindi naman talaga nakahubad yung face mask ng passenger ko. walang cam kotse ko. pero nakakairits lang na paransabihin na not wearing face mask na yung ginawa. salamat sa sasagot."
13997,X,"warning ed, verbal abuse, child abuse my grandparents are just as toxic as my parents. my mom and dad are a couple of spineless cowards. takot rin sila sa lolot lola ko, kaya hindi nila kami ipinagtatanggol pag dinidisiplina kami. i am the first of three siblings and the only female. our family lived in our ancestral home because my mother was my lolo and lolas favorite daughter. growing up in the 90s, my lolo and lola always found food and mealtime as the best means to punish me with. at around four years old to 8, talagang may kahinaan ako kumain. my lolo would always be the one to serve me food. sa akin niya lang ito ginagawa. every time ang dami niyang ilalagay sa plato ko na combination of kanin mixed with whatever viand were having na halos an inch a way na lang from the edge of the plate sa sobrang dami. as in, itsura pa lang, nalulunod na ako. he would sit across me from the dining table and watch me like a hawk during meal time. he would remind me ever so often to take a bite. putang ina. wag mo tungangaan yan. sumubo ka!, wag mo susuhin yang pagkain mo! lulunin mo yan!, ano? kakain ka, o isusubsob kita sa pagkain mo na parang aso? some nights, nagwawala siya pag di ako makalampas sa tatlong subo. may isang beses na pinagbabasag niya yung plato kot baso habang nagsisisigaw. tumigil rin kumain yung buong pamilya kasi nalagyan ng mga bubog yung pagkain namin. i remember crying myself to sleep that night nang hindi na nakapaligo pa sa sobrang takot. whenever i cannot finish my meal which is almost every meal, every day, paparusahan ako. the parusa can range from having rights, privileges and my favorite things taken from me. from no tv especially on weekends, my fave books get taken away as well as my toys bawal ko rin hawakan at kalaruin yung aso namin kung di, papaluin ng lolo ko yung aso para pati daw yung alaga ko magtanda. anong kinalaman nung aso sa di ko pagkain? bakit siya dapat magtanda!? sometimes my fave toy at the moment gets placed in the middle of the dining table and i only get to touch it if i finish my meal. since hindi ko nga kaya , i usually just bid these toys goodbye. yung isa kong polly pocket, nakuha ko na at 12 ish years old. naoutgrow ko na siya. so, to remedy this i worked on being able to eat. then, i gained weight around my preteens given the amount of rice i was supposed to finish daily, my lola started taking over out of the blue. all she did was bully me whenever were eating. especially pag may ibang tao like if we have guests or were eating out. she would yell things at me. stuff like nonstop talaga yang bunganga mong putang ina ka noh? kaya ka lumolobo eh. one time my uncle winced and called her out when he heard her say anlakilaki ng ng tiyan mo, panay saksak mo pa rin ng pagkain sa muka mong tang ina ka. when we were out sa grocery, she woud shame me sa mga sales people and sa cashier telling them na. lahat yan para dito lang sa elepante ko. or when i would pick an item for myself she would scream out loud for other shoppers to hear na sige! lamon! ang galing galing mo talaga pag dating sa pagpili ng lalamunin mo! and she would do this angrily. hindi passive agressive. as in galit at pasigaw. kaya super nakakahiya. when shes in a subtle mood. she would mockingly immitate the way i chew and would laugh calling me babuy! or would sarcastically comment on my appearance pag halimbawa nakaayos ako ganda mo, para kang palanggana. she would also deny me of food at times. say for example she buys a box of donuts, ako lang ang di pwede kumuha. and at times, would accuse me of stealing food or treats at home only to find out na ang kumuha ay either of my brothers. my brothers would deliberately shield me and even so. sasabihin niya na tinakot ko daw yu g mga kapatid ko kaya pinagtatakpan ako. because of this, my brothers learned na magpaalam even for just a handful of mms para wag nila ako makitang pinagtitripan ng lola ko. and because i was just so over this treatment, nag diet naman ako. hindi ko namalayan na sumosobra na pala. it didnt help na in the 2000s the proanamia movement was in full swing. and the media was advocating for thinnes overall. the fashions at the time also favored slim frames. sick as it may seem, i found refuge in bingeing and purging. nakakain ko lahat ng gusto ko without having to gain weight. i also felt that i looked great in the latest trends at that time. i got hospitalized in 2007 for contracting a fatal gastrointentional infection which almost took me out because i was too weak to fight it. violent stomach upsets ba naman at vomitting and diarrhea ang primary symptoms. i weighed only 85lbs at 5ft. 3. if it werent for this infection, i wouldnt have been diagnosed with bulimia. it took a nutritionist, our family gastroenteroligist and my first psychiatrist and a couple of female professors na parang mommy figure ko sa school to help get me back to a healthy 115 lbs. i tried to work hard with them to get my life back. pero sa bahay, everything i went through was treated as nothing more than a physiological issue. walang may gusto mag address nung trauma which caused it all. they say, thats my psychs job. yung mommy ko naman, sinasabi niya na hindi niya maalala yung mga kinuwento ko sa inyo dito kanina. but she was always there when this happened. my brothers remember it too! mas naiiyak ako rito pag naiisip ko keysa sa mga pinagsasasabi sa akin ng lolo at lola ko. like, how can mom not remember? yun ba ang trauma response niya? selective amnesia? dahil ba hindi niya kakayanin kung di lilimutin ng utak niya as a form of defense? idk, pero parang mas nasasaktan ako doon. i feel so betrayed. in my 20s i got myself a career one na super minahal ko, pero sucked the soul out of me kasi very competitive and demanding. that time, i got back into bingeing and stopped seeing my psychiatrist and nutritionist all together. kasi, ako na ang magbabayad sa kanila eh. that time though, hindi na ako nagpupurge. i buried myself in work and sweets. before i know it i was gaining weight again. each time i get stressed, i will take my anger and frustration out on a whole cake, a tub of ice cream or makikipag inuman ako pero ang chaser ko 1.5 na coke at sa akin lang yun. donuts held a special place in my heart. kada may magbubukas na bagong donut shop, you can expect to see me falling in line to get a box! i also had candy in my pockets too. all. the. time! expensive candy or cheap candy is just the same to me. basta candy. i remember my psych said that my obsession with it had something to do with candy being the instrument my lola used as a trap nung bata ako. now, i am just all too happy na i wouldnt get in trouble for being able to access it as an adult. it didnt come as a surprise sa akin na lumobo ako, this time 3x from when i first gained weight as a preteen. i am fullon obese. where was my lolo and lola? nasa bahay pa rin. so, what i did to avoid them was that i left for work early and leave very late at night. i would even just chill with my boyfriend on weekends wag lang ako matambay sa bahay. from then on, i just lived every day as an obese woman. lahat ng milestones ko in life, i achieved as a fat woman. hindi sa proud ako. thats just what i am. severely depressed and fat but somehow unstoppable maachieve ang work goals ko. then, i had a very bad, unexpected mental breakdown in 2013. kaya i decided to see a new psychiatrist. i was then diagnosed with ptsd and my chronic depression was due to a hormonal imbalance pala. i got treated for the depression and ptsd. pero hirap ako maging physiologically healthy through food. no matter how much media i consume about living and eating healthy i cant seem to get it right. in 2017, i had a major fight with my lolo and finally ibinulalas ko na lahat ng hinanakit ko. pinagmumumura ko siya, at sinabihan rin ng masasakit na salita. i almost physically assaulted him, pero napigilan ako ng kapatid ko. he knew na siguradong mapapahamak ako if i were to lay a hand on my dirtbag of a lolo. jut imagine my obese ass hitting an 80 year old man. i knew that was the end of my stay at that house. lumayas ako nang walang pagdadalawangisip and lived with my boyfriend just a month before our wedding. my brother helped me pack at siya ang naghatid sa akin. i never returned home. my brothers were also theorizing na my lolo deliberately planned on riling me up para mag clash kami because i was about to have a big life event and he just felt like pissing on it. just like how all of a sudden, bigla siyang nagwala bago yung debut ko dati. one of my brothers also thought that kaya sa akin pinaka galit yung grandparents namin ay dahil daw, naging kaagaw nila ako sa attention ng mommy ko anak nila mula nang ipanganak ako. yun ang sabi nila. ako? ewan ko! talagang hindi ko na lang siya kaya pagtimpian. all i feel is rage and contempt. i saw my lolo again during my lolas funeral. she died 5 months after ko maglayas. namatay siya nang di kami nag uusap at galit ako sa kanya. when i heard the news i was the only one who had a hard time weeping for her. ff to now? i am living life in my mid 30s with maintenance meds for hypertension, borderline diabetis and chronic depression. but, there is a silver lining. i married a kind, understanding and gentle husband na hindi ako nagsasawang paalalahanan na walang parusa na naka abang sa akin pag hindi ko naubos ang pagkain ko. at, hindi ko na kailangan kainin ang feelings ko, dahil nandito siya para pakinggan ako nang walang paghuhusga. i have had so many doctors try to help me, but i believe that it is only he who is actually healing my inner child little by litte."
13998,X,"so this happened yesterday. i was hanging out at a friends house with his fiance. incidentally my friends kuya has his business office beside my friends unit. yung kuya nya and his kabit were currently hanging out in the business office. then unannounced, dumating yung asawa nung kuya, bitbit yung 10 year old son. yung mga tauhan ng older brother, nataranta and they immediately informed the kuya na parating yung asawa at anak, kaya nailock kaagad yung pinto ng office and the kuya pretended na wala sya sa office. hindi makatakas yung kabit kasi magkakasalubong sila nung asawa at anak. the kuya then called my friends phone to ask for help, basically to entertain the asawa while staying outside the office, habang trapped inside yung kuya nya sa office with his kabit na hindi makatakas habang nasa labas lang yung asawa at anak. ang plano, invite ng friend ko yung asawa ng kuya nya sa loob ng unit ng friend ko... basically para hindi makita at makatakas yung kabit. lmao. so ayun lumabas kami ng friend ko sa unit and my friend made casual convo with kuyas asawa, inviting her to stay in my friends unit since kuyas office is locked. kaso hindi nag work yung plano, sabi nung asawa, dun na lang daw sila mag stay sa labas ng office, din na lang maghintay sa pagdating ng asawa. medyo na tense ako sa sitwasyon kasi ayoko may mangyaring eskandalo habang andun yung 10 year old to witness a possible catfight between kabit and his mom. a few minutes later, dumating yung nanay ng kuya at friend ko... may bitbit na pagkain na bibigay sana sa kuya. hinanap ng nanay sa mga tauhan ni kuya, sabi ng mga tauhan di pa dumadating si kuya. so ayun chika chikahan yung nanay at asawa ng kuya ng friend ko. lalo ako kinabahan. iniisip ko kung kakuntsaba yung nanay sa pagtatago sa kabit or kung wala din syang alam. pero biglang nag invite yung nanay na pumunta sila sa jollibee para kumain muna, libre daw nya, habang wala si kuya ng friend ko. so dun ko na realize na kakuntsaba sya para mapaalis yung asawa sa office para makatakas yung kabit. lmao. so ayun, umalis yung nanay kasama yung asawa at anak ng kuya ng friend ko papuntang jollibee. sinigurado muna nila na nakaalis na yung nanay asawa anak ng dali dali bumukas yung pinto ng office at nagmamadaling umalis yung kabit... nagpaalam yung kabit sa friend ko and my friends fiance... hindi na nakatingin si kabit sa akin, siguro nahiya din na baka jinajudge ko sya. lol. sabi ko sa friend ko... grabe, kinabahan ako dun... akala ko may mag aaway na at magkakahulihan... but in the end, the pagtatago mission was a success, kasi everyone helped cover up the kabit... yung mga tauhan ng kuya, yung friend ko and his fiance, yung nanay ng kuya at friend ko was also in on it. napaisip ako bakit complicit yung nanay at yung friend ko sa kalokohan ng kuya nya. yung kuya nya is a successful businessman. most of the income ng nanay galing sa business ng kuya. pati yung friend ko, some of his income comes from his kuyas businesses. matic yung mga tauhan ng kuya ng friend ko syempre loyalty sa nagpapa sweldo sa kanila. i wonder how common this scenario is in filipino culture... kung saan pinagtatakpan yung kabit para lang walang away gulo. care to share your stories and insights?"
13999,X,"it pains my chest, mahirap po manghingi sa mga hindi ko kakilala pero andito po ako sa rphilippines nanghihingi ng tulong. never ko pa pong ginawa to, at sana po matulungan niyo ang aso ko. my dogs name is nala. f and maltichon. nakuha ko po siya from cavite last august 17, 2 days after my birthday. pinanganak siya ng june 27 2019. me and my girlfriend shared the load mula sa pagbili sa kanya hanggang sa lahat ng gastos, foods and mga vitamins niya, pati mga toys na nasira niya at nginatngat. eto po siya nung puppy to medyo adult niya puppy nala bago ko siya makuha alam ko pong sa breed nila and sa mga long coats, prone sila sa hotspots pero hindi ko inaakalang masosobrahan naman ng gnito. nagsimula hotspot niya early this year january, inisip ko dahil nagsimula ng uminit kaya ganun since wala naman kaming aircon, so bumili kami ng cream para sa kanya. medyo gumana pero may bago nanaman hanggang sa lumilipat lipat lang. gumagaling naman walang problem pero never siyang gumaling ng todo kasi lilipat lang yung sugat sa bagong lugar. pina skin scrape test namin siya nung february pero negative naman ang results sa infection or bacteria daw, so hotspot lang tlga. we continued the treatment, naka more than 1k na continuously pero ok lang gumaling lang si nala. her scar from the big hotspot akala namin ok na pero end of february nagkaroon siya ng maliit na hotspot sa likod, so vet ulit at nilagyan namin ng cream pero iba to, this time lumaki ng lumaki, wala kaming magawa kundi lagyan siya ng elizabethan cone at i monitor pero hindi nag stop yung hotspot. may vet pa na pumunta ng bahay para i assist kme sa pag gupit sa buhok niya. dumating yung point na halos kinain na yung buong back niya at sa sobrang desperado ko nagtanong tanong na ako sa ibang vet, lahat pareho conclusions, hotspot daw. dumating ang ecq at nagsaraduhan na ang mga clinic around last week of march at wala na akong mapuntahang clinic. sarado na din ung lagi naming pinagcoconsultahan. so nakahanap kami ibang clinic dun ko siya dinala, nilakad namin for 30 mins dalawa ni nala para ma skin scrape siya, negative ulit ang findings.. tinuklap hotspot niya at inapplyan ng cream. binigyan kame gamot na nag cost around 2k pero sabi ko ok lang para naman to kay nala. 1 week after, walang nangyari, lumala pa. first cream is jojoba cream nagbago kami ng clinic at nakahanap ako ng mas malapit. gamot ulit 2k plus pero dahil sa laki ng sugat ni nala, yung cream at spray 1 week lang tinatagal, meron pa siyang vitamins, anti histamine kasi dinedetermine kung sa food ba tapos meron ding antibiotics. every week starting first week ng april more than 2k ang gastos namin. nahihirapan din ako dahil ako lang ang nagaalaga sa aso ko, wala ang gf ko at naka ecq. gumaling ang likod niya pero kagaya dati a day before bumalik ulit kme ng vet, kinamot niya mukha niya ng gabi, yes matalino siya naaabot niya ung mukha niya kahit may cone. nakakagawa siya ng paraan minsan para matanggal ang cone at sobrang hirap kasi hindi ko siya mabantayan pag tulog ako. pag gising ko ung kaliwang face niya puro dugo. gumaling likod niya though may mga marks pa rin pero this time face naman.. nakalmot niya na face niya dito mapapansin niyo may buhok siya sa mukha kasi hindi siya pwede kalbuhin dun. malakas pa din siya kumain. sinugod ko kagad siya sa vet para matanggal yung buhok niya sa mukha pero need siya patulugin, more than 2k ang singil kasama ang gmot, hindi ko kaya. draftsmen po ako at sumasahod ng minimum, wala akong hazard pay since ecq at naubos na pera ko. dumating ang time na nangutang na ako sa clinic, yes kinapalan ko mukha ko at nangutang ako. 2 days after nung kamot niya, pati yung left ng mukha niya nadamay na. by this time, more than 10k a month na ang gastos ko, at wala na akong pera. nangutang na ako sa clinic para lang mabigyan ng gamot si nala, nanghingi na din ako tulong sa mga pinsan ko para lang maging ok si nala. nagcontinue to hanggang may at gladly nag dry na yung sugat niya sa mukha. masaya na ako kahit papano pero may bago siya ulit na sugat, sa paws naman niya at legs, hindi niya to abot dati pero nakagawa siya ng paraan para maabot yung legs niya, tumatayo siya tapos ngangatngatin. ngayong araw sinugod ko ulit siya sa vet, kahit 3 days ko ng nililinis sugat niya na puno ng nana, walang nangyayari lumalaki lang, tinanong ko kung lalagyan ba ng busal pero wag na daw. walang allergy si nala, ever since na nagkahotspot siya never namin siya binigyan ng chicken. tumigil kami sa dog food dahil parang nag stress eating siya nung nagkasakit siya, ang pinapakain ko lang ay gulay ampalaya, cabbage, carrots etc. atay ng baboy at mga boiled pork. bumili pa ako ng mga separate na pagkain para sa kanya lang mula march pero wala tlga. since na eliminate na ang food allergy, baka daw sa bahay pero dito lang naman siya at d ko nilalabas since nagkasakit siya, lagi naman namin nililinis every 2 days ang kwarto at nag mop sa floor. dito na na determine ng vet na mukhang systemic na daw ang sakit ni nala. nasa nervous system na ata and since na exhaust na lahat ng gamot, ang last resort daw is injection. hindi ko natandaan pangalan nung injection pero ang sabi ni doc 8k daw yung injection at oorder pa siya. pero wala na po akong pera. lahat ng gamot ni nala, 4x na spray dermaclens, 4x na dermaclens cream, ibat ibang antibiotics, antihistamine at vitamins. spray for disinfection, jojoba ear cleanser, madre de cacao cleanser, bandages, venuma etc. ako po si mervin, pwede niyo kong tawaging vin or vince. draftsmen or junior architect, minimum wage, no hazard pay. makikita niyo sa pictures ang timeline ng sakit ni nala, pati mga gamot na napuno na ang cabinet para lang sa kanya. hindi na ako mahihiya at manghihingi na ako ng tulong. ayokong mawala si nala, napakalambing niya at mabait. naisip ko siyang ipa adopt pero baka makagawa pa ako ng paraan, baka makahingi pa ako ng tulong. if need niyo pa ng proof sabihin niyo lang sken, pwede ako magbigay ng id copy o kung ano man. wala po akong bank acct meron lang akong gcash. kaya dun na lang sana kung pwede po, sobrang salamat sa lahat ng makakabasa neto lalo na sa makakatulong, balang araw mababalik ko din to sa inyo. hindi ko alam kung pwede ko iwan number ng gcash ko pero para safe please i dm niyo po ako. sobrang kailangan ni nala ng tulong, kung may mabibigay din kayong gamot or kung ano pa or kahit opinion lang tungkol sa sakit niya nagpapasalamat na ako agad. sana matulungan niyo si nala. salamat. note wala po akong way par masabi ilan na nagdonate, if pwede po sana, pakilagyan ng username niyo sa message para every few hours ma edit ko ang thread para malagay ko po sinong user ang nag donate

14006,X,"genuinely curious lang. puro nalang kasi basketball nilalaro dito. sa ibang bansa, yung basketball mga 4th or 5th lang in terms of popularity and they have a lot of sports to choose from. dito, when you take a look around sa lahat ng schools, from highschools to universities, puro basketball courts lang meron. i feel so bad sa mga current high school students na hindi basketball yung naeenjoy nilang game pero theyre forced to play it anyway kasi no choice. ive been there once and honestly it got to the point na i felt less of man just honestly, i still think this is true, at least in our society because i didnt know how to play it back then. alam ko madame na rin nagpost dito sa subreddit na to about why basketball is so popular here in the ph, and i know all of them either got hostile answers or got downvoted to oblivion. so instead of asking the same thing again, narealize ko di pa naask yung isa sa mga tanong regarding basketball that has been lurking in the back of my mind ever since dont you guys ever get tired of basketball? lmao. kahit mga pinoys living abroad, basketball din favorite sport and some of them even refuse the most popular sport in their respective countries. i have a cousin and boyfriend nya pinoy guess what kung ano sport pineplay nya? yep. basketball. mga classmates ko ngayon sa college hulaan nyo ano yung mga pinopost? puro nba parin. dont get me wrong. you do you. if you guys enjoy the sport so much please do. pero as in, nakakapagtaka talaga legit, wala na kayong ibang sport na hinawakan. and i think marami rin magbribring up na sikat din naman daw dito volleyball and billiards. lmfao. may point pero its not as popular as basketball. in every street may random basketball court. volleyball are put into the sides din, may nagsabe din sakin na marami naman daw billiaran sa tabitabi. what? ilang taon na ko nakatira sa metro manila and yes, may billiaran here and there pero exaggerated naman ata na madame yung billiaran. point is, super popular ng basketball dito sa ph na nadwadwarf nya na other sports that we couldve been better at. so there. may iba pa ba kayong sports bukod sa bball na nilalaro? hindi pa ba kayo nagsasawa sa basketball?"

14016,X,"i might get downvoted for this but i just rly cant stand ppl who support bbm and ive reached the point where im willing to cut ties. im surrounded by apologists both family and friends. im from leyte btw, which explains a lot. nalulungkot ako kasi these were my best friends during senior high were in different college universities now. we basically did everything together, studied got good grades, shared secrets packed lunches, sneaked out, laughed, cried, even promised to be there at each others weddings. we were each others support system, and now im not so sure anymore. i admit its partly my fault because i tend to share a lot of political posts and memes on my account, to the point na nagiging offensive na sa kanila. in my defense, my posts are always based on the truth, but they think its all paninira and negative campaigning. according to them, we should just respect each others opinions. one of them also stated that studying in up does not equate to that person being smarter than others who dont, kasi sa attitude pa rin daw nagmamatter lahathow you treat and respect people despite their political beliefs. syempre, natamaan ako kasi im the only one in our inner circle who entered up. i try to be understanding naman, but sometimes i just lose my shit especially whenever someone redtags me or makes fun of leni sa posts ko, or worst, invalidates the sufferings of martial law victims. this has been going on since the start of the pandemic kasi i was vocal against du30s pandemic response, in which they implied na puro lang daw ako reklamo. i even got in a heated argument with one of them sa isang post ko which is why dumistansya muna ako. last feb, naging okay ulit kami because i invited them over for my birthday. naginitiate din ako na walang magtotopic ng politics just so we could just chill and enjoy the day. ngayon, bumabalik nanaman kami sa parinigan via shared posts. di ako nakakapaniwala na they choose to be blind until now. naiinis ako kasi they have the access to information naman, and i believe that its every citizens responsibility to be socially and politically aware. idk what to do anymore. am i selfish for wanting a different environment? pagod na pagod na ako, walang nakakaintindi sa akin. pati parents ko, dinidismiss lang mga sinasabi ko. ilang araw na akong bigla nalang naiiyak esp with the fact that leni didnt win the fear of my future as a comm student in up hahahuhu pls adopt me"

14032,X,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero its not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta also i want to clarify that i didnt post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isnt caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila. we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses whether if its the regular flu or covid. yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito."

14059,X,"hi po! random post po! i just want to share my knowledge about sogie dahil pride month po ngayon. sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression ito po ang laging napaghahalo ng mga tao sex, gender, at sexual orientation assigned sex ito po ang sex natin sa birth certificate na siyang kinumpirma ng mga duktor noong tayoy nailuwal. afab assigned female at birth at amab assigned male at birth po ang dalawang nabibilang sa assigned sex. male at female po sa madaling salita intersex pambihirang pangyayari kung saan hindi maiuri ang isang tao sa gender binary lalaki ba o babae? dahil ang pangangatawan andor ang sex chromosomes ng naturang tao ay alanganin at maselan. underdeveloped genitalia, coexistence of male and female sex organs in a human body, abnormal sex chromomes bakit wala po sa mga birth certificatelegal and medical documents ang intersex na category??? dahil hindi ito gaanong documented at hindi narerecognize ng maraming tao due to its rarity. it is so rare that not everyone knows about them because intersex people choose to conform to the gender binary to avoid attracting negative attention. please watch that one video in jessica soho about a man that menstruates. he is practically an intersex, but he identifies and was identified as a man because his phenotype outward appearance presents as that of a typical biological male. gender a social construct that simplifies and categorizes the norms that people should follow or conform onto according to their assigned sex. dahil po rito, nakikilala po natin kung ang isang tao ba ay lalaki o babae sa unang sulyap natin sa kanilang bihis, kilos, at panlabas na anyo. gender binary malefemale identity cisgender,cissexual, transgendertranssexual, or nonbinary cisgender people that are afab or amab that matches with their gender identity. afab na nagaidentify as female at amab na nagaidentify as male. another term for this is cissexual focusing on the biological aspect of the person rather than their gender identity transgender people who identify on a gender that does not match their assigned sex. maaaring sila ay operado sex reassignment surgery o hindi operado without surgery. maaaring sila ay umiinom ng hrt hormone replacement therapy pills o hindi. kapag ang isang tao ay nagpabago na ng kaniyang anatomy and physiology, transsexuals na sila... though transgender is still the umbrella term. what about legal documents? sa pilipinas, ipinagbabawal po ang pagpapalit ng pangkapanganakang kasarian natin sad news for trans people kahit na ikaw ay nagpasex change na. bagkus, pinapayagan ito under medical conditions nagkamali ang doctor ng assignment sa sex mo, nagkaroon ka ng issues sa pagbibinatapagdadalaga mo due to possession of intersexual traits.. and this is also debatable on court. nonbinary spectrum ng mga taong ayaw magpatawag na fully lalaki o babae. maaaring nagaalangan sila sa kanilang identity o dili kaya ay mga intersex individuals who live up to their intersexuality. maaari ring nagrerefer ito sa mga taong nasa spectrum ng pagiging cisgendertransgender kinikilala ba nila ang pagiging _________ nila from birth as their gender or gusto nilang sumakabilang kasarian? enby people belong between these two ends of the spectrum sexual orientation 2 types. sexual or asexual? kapag asexual ka, wala kang gusto. kapag sexual ka naman, nagkakagusto ka. sexual subtypes heterosexual straight, homosexual samegenderattraction , bisexual samegender at different genders from yours ay attracted ka, at marami pa pong iba. transexuality is not a sexual orientation, sexual identity po siya. summary sex male or amab, female or afab, intersex it varies from case to case identities cis, trans, nb gender manboyladlalaki, womangirlladybabae, nb sexual orientation asexual, sexual straight and the nonstraight categories. at the end of this long post, i just want to say na matuto tayong gumalang sa pagkakakilanlan at pagibig ng ating kapuwa dahil may mga kaniyakaniya tayong mga pinagdaanan sa buhay na siyang humubog sa pagkatao natin ngayon. ilayo natin ang usapang panrelihiyon dahil walang nakaaalam kung ano ba ang tunay na pananampalataya o hindi. subalit, ang taong iyong nakahahalubilo ay totoongtotoo, at bilang isang tao, ayon sa konstitusyon, likas sa atin ang karapatang igalang ng ating kapuwa sa kung sinuman tayo. ultimo ang kriminal nga ay iginagalang eh. ano pa kaya ang inosenteng lgbtq na kapuwa nating ipinagsasakdal sa kaniyang pagibig? nakasakit ba siya ng kapuwa sa pagiging totoo niya sa kaniyang sarili? nakapapatay ba ng tao ang pagiging bakla? mapanira ba ito sa kalikasan, kabuhayan, at kalusugan ng ibang tao? hindi!!! kasalanan ba ang pagiging bakla? aywan ko sa inyo. pinalaki akong atheist eh hahahahaha ano ba ang sabi ng diyos ninyo? anyways, respeto na lang sa paniniwala ninyo i guess. but what is not respectable is the violence towards the lgbtq community. if you participate, promulgate, andor enable this, you are not worthy of my attention. i may respect you but i cannot tolerate you. unless you choose to change for the better, you deserve whatever criticism you will consequently receive for your closemindedness. we have to remember na huwag tayong paspecial sa mundong ito. 8 billion ang mga tao, at iisa ka lang. the only constant moral standard in this world is to be makatao. put yourselves in the shoes of others you are trying to judge. do they deserve it? if it were you, do you deserve it? alang sa lahat ng mga baklang bakla lgbtq community nagmahal, nakibaka, nabigo, napatay, napatahimik, at napagkaitan ng kanilang kaligayahan at kalayaang maging sila, ipinagbubunyi ko kayo sa pamamagitan ng pagdiriwang ng pride month na ito. bilang kabahagi ng mga lgbtq, patuloy kong ipaglalaban ang karapatan ng bawat tao opo, pati ang mga straight. sa kanilang sogie hanggang makamtan natin ang mga karapatang magpoprotekta at kikilala sa atin bilang mga pilipinong nagmamahal at may karapatang magmahal sa sinumang nais nilang sintahin. simulan po natin sa pagpuna sa mga taong mapanakit sa mga lgbtq sa kanilang kilos at pananalita hanggang sa pagboto sa mga pulitikong magsusulong ng mga karapatang pantao ng mga pilipino. sa mga makababasa po nito. maraming salamat po sa inyong pagtitiyaga at malawakang pagunawa! happy pride month po sa ating lahat"

14067,X,"hi rphilippines my dad was almost a victim of dugo dugo gang scam. basically, they will contact the victim and tell them na someone they know got into an accident and will ask to send a huge amout of money to avoid being detained. someone called my dad this afternoon saying na they are from pasay traffic bureau. they said na i got into an accident and was detained somewhere. the thing is im in my girlfriends place and i dont bring a car with me. good thing my dad has always been careful about these things and decided to contact me. he knew naman na im safe hes just checking and explaining na hes being scammed. my sister then put me in speaker phone so i can hear them catch these suckers try and lie their way through. my dad asked them if they can talk to me and someone answered. my sister had a hunch na they were just using voice changers kasi sobrang obvious with the tone and their choice of words. they were asking 65,000 for bail money. they sent a gcash number din to whom they can send the bail money to as well as several contact numbers. the thing is they can be easily mistaken as legit as they really gave out the real number to pasay traffic. but my dad called the number to confirm it was jndeed theirs but they said na they havent gotten any reports and somehow confirmed it na it was a scam. we already reported the incindent to pnp cybercrime and gcash, im posting here for awareness. also including the numbers they use just in case someone contacts you. scammer gcash account 09271337536 telephone number 85521349 88616116 also, i believe my dads personal info was compromised asking for tips on what can we do moving forward? thank you and stay safe."

14073,X,"last year, my aunts partner of eight years died from sudden cardiac arrest. now, heres the real problem my stepuncle is married to another woman. no, hindi kabit si tita. separated sila because the legal wife is a cheater. nabuntis ng kuya nung stepuncle ko. now, si tito, gustong magpaannull pero theres no valid cause and its freaking expensive pa. so, imagine kung anoano ang mga nagpapahirap ngayon sa loob ni tita wala siyang karapatan sa katawan ni tito. ni hindi man lang niya nakita ang katawan bago nicremate. nasa abroad si tito until three years ago. noong naging sila, nagpundar si tito ng negosyo palaisdaan at si tita ang nagpalago noon. syempre, dugo at pawis ni tita ang puhunan pero wala, di rin siya entitled dito. pinaalis na si tita sa bahay ni tito. at ang titira doon ay ang legal wife pati yung tarantadong kapatid. worst parehong si legal wife at kapatid ang makikinabang sa lahat ng pera ni tito. at ngayon, walang pera si tita. ni hindi man lang siya hinire sa palaisdaan because the bitchy legal wife wants nothing to do with her. nakakagalit lang. imagine, kumerengkeng siya tapos ngayon, sarap buhay sila sa pera ng niloko niya? guys, this is why i support and will always support divorce. di ko naman kinakailangang manggaling sa problematic na pamilya para marealize na mayroong taong deserve na makalaya dito. to all religious bastards who still dont see the problem here, fuck you and your sense of entitlement. hindi ka dadalhin sa langit ng pagiging selfrighteous mo."
14074,X,"marami akong nakikitang mga tanong sa kung papaano iconvince ang mga tao, lalo na yung family and friends natin na hardcore ddsbbm supporter na iboto si leni. ang sagot ko diyan, huwag niyo muna silang kumbinsihin na iboto si leni. mahirap yan. ang gawin niyo, huwag niyo munang sabihin yung preference niyo o di kaya, magsinungaling kayo tapos sabihin niyo na mas iboboto niyo pa si pacquiao kaysa kay bongbong. ginamit ko ito sa papa ko. ilokano kami, kaya bbm halos lahat ng tao dito sa bahay, pati na yung mga kapitbahay namin. nagkaroon kami ng medyo mainitan pero friendly na debate sa kung sino ba ang dapat na iboto. round 1 namin, siyempre, kay leni ako, bbm siya. nasabi ko naman lahat ng dapat sabihin, na malinis si leni, hindi magnanakaw at performing as a public servant. sinabi ko pa na magnanakaw si marcos, mamamataytao, magiging tuta ng china, blablabla kaso sobrang buo ang tiwala ng papa ko kay bbm. kesyo maganda daw ang buhay niya noong martial law, maraming napagawa, blablabla ulit. at saka sinasabi niya din na kokontrolin lang si leni ng liberal party at ng mga aquino. napakahirap irefute ng mga arguments niya sa totoo lang kasi convinced na siya sa mga nabasa niyang kasinungalingan sa social media. from a moral and my own point of view, panalo ako sa debate namin pero hindi ko siya naconvince, even just by an inch. sumunod na araw, round 2 namin at siya ang naginitiate haha kasi gusto din akong asarin ng papa ko kung bakit kay leni lugaw ako. hindi ko gustong manalo sa debate, gusto ko siyang maconvince na maling iboto ang mga marcos. doon ko nasabi na mas iboboto ko pa si pacquiao kaysa kay bbm. sinabi ko na may ok pa si pacquiao kaysa kay bbm kasi si pacquiao, never nagnakaw, hindi umasa sa apelyido ng magulang at laki sa hirap, makadiyos kahit atheist ako hahaha, at higit sa lahat, hindi papatay. in a connotative way, umikot ang ulo ng papa ko. nastuck up siya. hindi siya makapaniwala na mas iboboto ko pa si pacquiao kaysa kay bbm. tingin ko, kaya hindi siya makapaniwala na mas iboboto ko pa si pacquiao kaysa kay bbm ay dahil alam naman nating lahat na sobrang kulang sa karanasan si pacquiao at magiging incompetent siyang presidente. saka tingin ko, narealize niya na ayoko sa mga marcos hindi dahil gusto ko kay leni, pero dahil nasusuklam ako sa mga kasamaang ginawa nila, to the point na handa kong ibigay ang boto ko sa pinakaincompetent candidate, which is si pacquiao. its been weeks noong huli kaming nagusap ng papa tungkol sa pulitika kahit biruan. tingin ko, di pa rin siya convinced kay leni pero palagay ko, mukhang hindi na siya convinced kay bbm, and its now one less vote para sa mga marcos. the good news is malayo pa ang eleksiyon, mapagiisipan niya pa ng mabuti kung sino ang iboboto niya. ps sorry for the wall of text. edit 1 hindi ako nanghihingi ng upvote kaso kasi, ang daming downvotes. sa palagay ko, may kulang pa sa sinabi ko or baka naoffend yung ibang super righteous diyan kasi bakit hindi na lang natin ikampanya directly si leni or i dont know. kung yung tao familyfriendstranger na kausap mo ay bbm supporter pero tingin mong hindi solid, or much better kung isko or ping supporter, then proselytize and campaign for leni all the way you want pero kung solid bbm yan, kahit lumuha kayo ng dugo, hindi niyan iboboto si leni. ang pinakamasakit pa doon, you already missed your chance, hindi na siya makikinig kasi alam niyang dilawan o komunista ka. im just saying na its much easier na bawasan ang 47 ni bbm according to october 2023 sws survey by helping people to realize how evil that family is kaysa pataasin sa ngayon ang support kay vp leni. mas may tiyansa si vp leni na manalo kung yung mga bbm supporters ay makoconvert into isko or ping voters."
14076,X,"hi rphilippines i just want to raise some awareness regarding to the dugodugo gang. eto yung mga scammer na tatawag through phone then will be ask for some money. nag fafabricate sila ng stories about your familylove ones na wala sa bahay niyo or umalis to run some errands. magagaling sila kasi as per my experience alam nila ang details name ng both parents ko and alam nila na umalis sila on the day that i was became there victim. both parents ko ay umalis that day, mga after an hours maybe 5hrs na sila umalis. then it happened na dala nila ang sasakyan ko, around 4pm afternoon nag ring ang telephonelandline namin dito sa bahay. they introduce themselves na they are from the makati city hall, since me and my family residing in makati. then they ask if yung natawagan nila is residence nila insert my parents name here. i said yes, then inask if sino ako at anak ba nila yung kausap nila, i answered again ng yes then after that questions, they asked again kung kaninong sasakyan yung gamit nila sinabi ko sa akin, im bit worried kasi parang masama na ang kutob ko na may nangyari na masama sa parents ko while they are outside. then after a while, nag kwento na yung caller na nainvolve daw ang parents ko sa accident beating red light and naka hit ng person, and nasaktan ang mother ko which is nabasag daw ang bibig since shes not using a seat belt and she cant speak, sinusulat lang daw ang sinabi while ginagamot and my father daw is hold ng police since siya ang nag dadrive. ako naman pregnant, and i have no clue na scam pala also worried ako sa parents ko since they went outside while im sleeping on that day. the caller said eto si mother mo kausapin mo mejo di siya makasalita ng maayos dahil injured siya sa bibig then the other line mimic my mothers voice as in gayang gaya yung boses ng mom ko! so hindi na ako nag isip na scammers pala ang kausap ko, hindi ko rin na anticipate na if something happened na accident dapat police officials ang pupunta or cocontact sa bahay namin, since siguro dahil sabi nila is they are from makati city hall hindi ko na rin talaga naisip na scam. the caller ask and the fake mom on the phone ask for the settlement daw muna sa attorney para hindi madetained ang father ko at settlement daw sa victim na nahit ng father ko, since sya daw ang driver. so i havent doubt na mag send ng big sum of money, since i was worried. after sending that settlement, mag send daw ulit ako pinakausap ulit yung fake mother as in for this time around walang palya gayang gaya ang boses ng mom ko!!! send daw ulit ako para daw tulong sa family nung nabangga. i sent again a big money! ihahatid nalang daw ang parents ko since they are in shock daw sa nangyari! then little did i know after that call, is fake pala and my parents are okay! i havent get my money back malaki laki ang nakuha nila sa akin plus the trauma for that. i already reported it sa pnp cybercrime group ang mga number nila na ginamit where i sent the money. this is an awareness for all na mag ingat, and let your love ones has a family password. if ever someone call via phone and mimic voices and act like your parents, ask the family password before convince yourself na totoong parentsfamily mo ang nasa linya ng call. anyways, heres the scammer numbers 63 927 1605 451 63 928 9483 712 they are notorious on this scam. ang nakakapagtaka sa galing nila alam nila ang full name ng parents ko. keep safe everyone. if something happened to someone like my story, be strong po. report it agad sa police and pray, na sana mahuli rin ang mga may sala. nakaka trauma but keep going, may masasama talagang tao na hindi marunong mag trabaho ng patas."

14080,X,"for those who read my first post on whats wrong with ph basketball, parang hipokrito ang ipopost ko ngayon. pero hear me out. ever since fiba wc 2019, binabacklash si chot reyes for an underwhelming job in coaching the national team. kahit si yeng guiao ang naghead coach ng gilas, the fact that reyes was suspended after the phaus brawl speaks a lot and was used as a guillotine to his long standing career. pero di natin maitatanggi na malaki ang nagawa ni chot sa national team. after an amazing performance in 2014 fiba wc, nabuhayan ng dugo ang mga pilipino na kampyeon. william jones cup. sea games. fiba asia cup. asian games. ilan lang to sa mga tournament na sinalihan ng gilas na si chot ang coach. lahat magaganda ang resulta. in his peak, he brought phs fiba world ranking to 28, our highest ever. as he resigns as gilass head coach, his track record is hard to match, even to top ph coaches. he may have been past his prime, but he is still an excellent coach who has brought the nation to greater heights in basketball. thank you, coach chot reyes. enjoy your retirement with a win from our chinese rivals."
14081,X,"kayo na po humusga, i dont know why this person and his family were never held accountable for their actions. this happened in an mmda clearing operation in pasig city. alias omay and his family assaulted, threatened, and humiliated mmda personnel and police officers while conducting a clearing operation back in may of 2023. and it was all caught on video which will serve as hardevidence. in the beginning of the video, you can see the mmda officer politely asking the father of omay the guy with the dreadlocks to give his license or they will be forced to tow his suv which is clearly obstructing the right of way in the area. the omay dude refused to give his license and threatened to leave. fast forward the next day... bumalik po yung mga mmda officers at andun ulit yung mga sigang family. nagkasagutan at kitang kita naman sa video na naghahanap ng away yung sigang family. nanipa at pinagmumura pa ang otoridad. it was later revealed that the grandmother is working directly for mayor vico sotto kaya malakas ang loob ng pamilya. sa buong video makikita po yung tambak tambak na kasong pwedeng isampa. up to this day nagtataka lang ako na bakit walang nangyaring action dito. there was never a proper closure. at parang takot na takot ang mmda at mga pulis na ipaaresto ang mga involved dito. sana i revisit itong pangyayaring ito kasi mas masahol pa ito sa mga nag viviral na road rage na binabalita ng media ngayon. fair warning nakakainit ng dugo ang buong video. i included the yt link for the whole video below. credits to dada koo youtube channel."

14090,X,"maharlika investment fund bill, antimamamayan, hindi sagot sa krisis pangekonomiya! mariiing tinututulan ng kilusang mayo uno, kasama ng ibat ibang organisasyon, ang panukalang batas na maharlika investment fund bill o sovereign wealth fund bill na itinataguyod sa kongreso ni marcos jr. kasapakat ang mga kaanak niyang si speaker martin romualdez at anak na si sandro marcos. ang maharlika investment fund bill ay panukalang batas na maglilikha ng isang bagong korporasyon ng gobyerno na pamumunuan ng walang iba kung hindi si marcos jr., ang pangulo ng pilipinas. layon ng batas na ito na pagsamasamahin ang mga pondo ng gsis p125 b, sss p50 b, land bank p50 b, development bank p25 b, at pondo mula sa gobyerno na nagkakahalaga ng p25 b para iinvest at pagkakitaan. ito ay bahagi ng planong pangekonomiya ni marcos jr. para makabangon umano ang bansa sa krisis. bilyong bilyong pondo ang nais gamitin ni marcos jr. na siya mismo ang mamamahala. minamadali ng mga kasapakat at kaanak ni marcos jr. sa kongreso na maipasa ang batas na ito nang wala man lamang konsultasyon sa mga maapektuhan. bakit dapat itong tutulan ng taumbayan? baon sa utang ang pilipinas. ayon sa pinakahuling tala, may p13.52 trilyong utang ang pilipinas. ang sovereign wealth fund na mayroon sa ibang bansa ay mga pondo na galing sa sobrang kita ng kanilang gobyerno at ito ang ginagamit nila para ipuhunan at pagkakitaan. hindi ito aplikable sa ating bansa na baon sa utang ang bansa, kung kayat sa konsepto pa lamang, palpak at walang mabuting maidudulot sa bansa ang panukalang batas na ito. dahil sa konsepto ng sovereign wealth fund, dapat itong manggaling sa sobrang pondo at kita ng gobyerno. malaking pagkakamali at ilegal na gamitin ang pondo ng sss at gsis na galing sa hulog ng mga manggagawa mula sa kanilang pawis at dugo sa ilang taong pagtatrabaho para dito. ayon kay justice carpio, illegal at unconstitutional na gamitin ng gobyerno ito para pagkakitaan dahil hindi nila ito pera, at may tukoy na paggagamitan na ito. ni wala man lamang konsultasyon na naganap kasama ang mga manggagawa hinggil dito. kagaya lamang ni marcos jr. ang kanyang amang diktador na si marcos sr. na ginamit ang coco levy fund ipon ng mga magsasaka na sa huli ay hindi nagamit ng mga magsasaka dahil ibinulsa ni marcos sr. at mga kasapakat nito. talamak na korapsyon at kroniyismo bilyon bilyong pondo na pagsasamahin at iinvest para pagkakitaan ang gagamitin para rito. pero ayon sa batas, ang anumang investment na papasukin nito ay exempted sa kasalukuyang mga batas, ibig sabihin hindi na kailangan pang dumaan sa mga batas kagaya ng government procurement reform act, philippine competition act, dividends law of 1994 mga batas para sa transparency at accountability. hindi na rin ito kailangang dumaan sa review ng office of the government corporate counsel. kayat ano ang aasahan natin sa batas na ito? bilyong bilyong pondo ang pinaguusapan natin dito na nasa ilalim ng kontrol ni marcos jr. at mga kasapakat nito. ang pamilya marcos ay may mahabang rekord at kilala sa buong mundo na madarambong at magnanakaw ng pondo ng bayan. hindi ito sagot sa lumalalang krisis pangekonomiya ng bansa. bagkus maaari pa nitong palalain ang dinaranas na kahirapan ng taumbayan. kaysa maharlika investment fund bill ang paspasan na ipasa sa kongreso, dapat unahin ang mga batas na tunay na makakatugon sa krisis ng bansa. nariyan ang mga panukala para sa pagtataas ng sahod, pagtanggal ng buwis sa langis at mga batayang produkto. at kung may pondo naman pala na p25 b na galing sa national government na ilalaan para sa maharlika investment bill, bakit hindi ito ilaan na ayuda para sa mga pinakamahihirap at nawalan ng kabuhayan? ito ang mas dapat kagyat na harapin ng gobyerno. kitangkita sa 2023 national budget na hindi ito nakalaan para sa kapakanan ng taumbayan. nariyan pa rin ang p10b b para sa ntfelcac, at bilyon bilyong confidential funds nina sarah duterte at marcos jr. sa limang buwan na nakaupo si marcos jr. wala siyang tugon sa panawagan ng mamamayan. hindi pa rin itinataas ang sahod ng mga manggagawa, wala pa ring ayuda ang mga maralita, nawalan ng trabaho, at maliliit na negosyo. imbes na patawan ng buwis ang mayayaman at malalaking korporasyon ay ipinapasa sa ordinaryong mamamayan ang bigat ng pasanin. malinaw na ang maharlika investment fund ay isang scam na pakana ni marcos jr. nililinlang nito ang taumbayan na ito ang tutugon sa lumalalang krisis ng bansa. kailangan nating magkaisa at kumilos para tutulan ito! sistematiko ang pagbabagong kailangan upang makawala ang mamamayang pilipino mula sa tanikala ng kahirapan at pagsasamantala. kinakailangang gawing prayoridad ang kapakanan ng mga manggagawa at magsasaka. nararapat na isulong ang pambansang industriyalisasyon at tunay na reporma sa lupa, hindi ang pagpapakatuta sa neoliberal na dikta ng mga imperyalista at dayuhan. tutulan at labanan ang maharlika investment fund!"

14100,X,"sinulat ko ito ilang linggo matapos malaman na ang aking nanay, si loren legarda, ay tumatakbong senador sa partidong pinangungunahan ng isang marcos at ng isang duterte. ineendorso niya ang mga pasista. ilang linggo na akong umiiyak, sumisigaw hanggang sa sumuka ng dugo. hindi ko maintindihan ang desisyon niya, walang konsensya, walang kapatawaran. sa nakaraang buwan, gumuho ang buong buhay ko. mas malala pa ito sa bangungot. hindi ako makapaniwala, hindi ko matatanggap. ilang linggo na akong paralisado ng sakit. pero, wala akong ibang magagawa kung hindi ideklara na nuknukan akong nasusulasok sa aking ina at sa kanyang mga naging desisyon. nakakapanghina at parang gusto ko na lang mamatay. kailangang malaman ng lahat na nawala na kay loren legarda ang anak niyang ito habambuhay. hayaan ninyo siyang mamula sa kahihiyan. wag ninyong hayaang makalimutan niya ito. katulad ng sabi ng isang matalinong babae hindi ko na siya kilala. kinailangan ang isang post ni ariana grande, kung saan kumakanta ng break free ang napakaraming tao sa rali, para kay leni, upang maalala ko na may eleksyon na paparating. hindi ako nakabase sa pilipinas simula noong edad18 hindi na rin nakabisita nang dalawang dekada, hindi na rin nagkasama ng aking nanay nang ganoon din kahaba, at hindi ko na alam kung sinusino mismo ang mga tumatakbo. subalit nasaksihan ko sa nakaraang anim na taon ang sindak, pagkamuhi, takot. ang pagkawalangpakialam ko ay isang pribilehiyo, na nakondisyon ng trauma sa kinalakihang bansa na kinikilala kong parating maysakit, at naimpeksyon ng amnesia sa kasaysayan at pagkakaila sa katotohanan. hanggang humantong na nga tayo dito. hindi ako papayag na maging normal na ang pamahalaang pasistang magnanakaw, ang mga kasinungalingan bilang alternate truth, ang kawawang kasaysayan ng bansa na sinusulat ngayon bilang pantasya. ehemplo ang nanay ko sa kung paano ang pasismo ay kumakapit, at maging katanggaptanggap, gawing normal, ifacilitate, igiya nang basta na lamang. kailangan ninyong malaman na wala siyang ideya tungkol sa todong bigat at kabuktutan ng ginagawa niya. so, nasa ticket nila ako. pasista na ba ako nun? tanong niya, nang may mapangutya at clueless. nakakakilabot. ang babaeng ito ay nasaksihan ang martial law isa siyang journalist na nagturo sa akin na pahalagahan ang katotohanan at hustisya. ganito na sila kasuklamsuklam, kawalangutak, at katatatapang ng apog ngayon. wala na silang ideya sa kung ano ang pinagagawa nila, at sa dekadekadang karahasan at dalamhati na ilalarga na naman. para sa kanya, isa na naman itong election year lang, hinog para sa mga mga naglalaway at oportunista muli lamang. walang paghihinuha na ang isa na namang marcos ay kikitil muli sa pilipinas. the end of history, ang hangganan ng kasaysayan. pinanganak ako noong dekada 90, nasa anino ng mga dekada ng kabuktutan, paniniil, at korapsyon ng mga marcos. hindi talaga ako makapaniwala kung paano napagtakpan ang mga krimen nila pagdating ngayon. pakiramdam ko at hinila na lang bigla ang carpet na kinatatayuan ko. ang litanya ng mga krimen na ginawa ng mga marcos ay hindi na dapat pagtalunan. ang mga kabuktutan ay known fact na, pawang katotohanan. para sabihin at ulitin pa nga ito dito ay absurd at katawatawa na. kung idedeny mo pa ang mga katotohanang ito, katumbas na iyon sa pagdeklara mo sa sarili bilang kalaban ng hustisya ng mga libulibong buhay at pamilya na winasak ng mga marcos at duterte ng milyunmilyong lumalaban sa frontline para pigilan sila. ang nanay ko, si loren legarda, ay dinuduruan silang lahat sa mukha. may isang indianong makata at aktibista na si aamir aziz, nilamon din siya ng kasamaan ng pasismo. sabi niya lahat ay matatandaan. iniisip kong dapat markahan hindi lang ang mga krimen na ginawa ng mga nasa kapangyarihan. kasama dapat sa tandaan ang mga nagluklok sa kanila sa kapangyarihan. markahan natin ang mga kakilalang bumoboto sa baluktot, wag nating kalimutan ang mga pangalan nila. tandaan na nagdeklara sila ng pagpayag sa mga ginagong bersyon ng kasaysayan, nang walang hiyahiya, katatapang ng apog, at nakaugat lahat sa kabuktutan. alam nila kung para saan ang boto nilapabor sa malawakang patayan, malawakang nakawan, pagkitil sa demokrasya, ang panarantado sa kasaysayandesperado silang gawin lahat yan. kapag umagos na ang dugo sa lansangan, huwag nating hayaang kalimutan nila na may dugo rin sa kanilang mga kamay, maalab at pulangpula. ipaalala natin sa kanila arawaraw. kagagawan na rin nila ang mga krimen. panagutin sila sa mga krimeng ito. kailangang akuin nila. salagin nila ang mga yan. lubos ang aking lungkot. tangina ang aking ina sa pagsulsol. ang mga krimen nila ay mga krimen na niya. subukan niyang lusutan ang mga yan. si lorenzo legarda leviste ay anak ni loren legarda decided to translate and post here for accessibility. no copyright infringement intended. will remove this post when called for by publisher or author."

14112,X,"question are animal sacrifices in rural areas catholic ceremonies or are they an offshootspinoff catholic mix blackmagic sort of thing? backstory im british, christian, baptist my fiance filipina, looselycatholic purchased a new car. wants to receive a blessing from the local rural catholic priest. apparently a goat is needed for its blood and will obviously need to be killed. i immediately asked if this was christian and she said catholic. shes also under a bit of pressure from her father to have this ceremony. i immediately quoted the new testament sapagkat ang dugo ng mga toro at mga kambing ay hindi makakapawi ng mga kasalanan. mga hebreo 104 rtpv05 pagkatapos ay sinabi pa niya, kalilimutan ko na ang kanilang mga kasalanan at kasamaan. sapagkat ipinatawad na ang mga kasalanan, hindi na kailangan pang maghandog dahil sa kasalanan. mga hebreo 101718 rtpv05 in other words summarising jesus came to offer himself once and for all for all the sins of mankind. animal blood no longer needs to be shed, because the blood of jesus has been shed. when we accept jesus as our savior, his blood cleanses us. then i asked my filipino friend, he asked his parents and they said that doesnt sound catholic. i also explained to her that the catholics local to me do not do this. im aware that in south america and africa there are many offshoots of catholicism that merge elements of voodoo, black magic and christianity together. i tried googling anything related to filipino animal sacrifices and no hits. ive taken to reddit here to ask, is this normal? has anyone heard of this before? im very open minded, and basically said to her, i wont judge what she does, however i dont agree with it or think its necessary and have advised her to query the need with her father. but its her decision ultimately. ive recommended a catholic priest bless with holy water and pray over the car and if she wants to hang a cross necklace in the car, by all means, do that and save a little goats neck. tldr questioning if fiance should challenge fathers wanting of an animal blood sacrifice for a catholic blessing ceremony in rural south philippines over a newly bought car. salamat."

14122,X,"share naman kayo dyan ng personal experiences nyo in dealing with government officials. medyo matanda na ako so madami ako experiences. please bear with me. 1. my gender in my birth certificate was male. i am female. naamend na yung law about 10 years ago ata. pero 20 years ago when i had this fixed, kelangan ng court order para lang baguhin yung record. the annoying thing was female actually yung copy ko. yung government copy ang mali. i will never know how that happened pero having been born in the 70s, im thinking na baka di gumamit ng carbon paper yung nagtype ng birth certificate ko sa civil registrar. nung binigay sa parents ko, they thought na tama kasi female naman. pero yun pala mali yung government record. when i needed to apply for passport the 1st time i needed to travel for work, kelangan ng updated copy of birth certificate. dun lang nadiscover na male ako on record. my lawyer told me to prepare 50k. note that this was in 1999. minimum wage at that time was 6k. that was a lot of money for a 20 year old. pero pinagipunan ko. after the hearing, i was told by the lawyer to hand 20 of the 50k to a lady. tinuro nya. so i handed the money. i asked for receipt. i was told by the lady that theres no receipt. i asked what the charge was for and she said commissioners fee. umakyat ata lahat ng dugo ko sa ulo ko. apparently, naglagay ako na di ko namalayan. i confronted my lawyer about it and she said that the bribe was necessary para unahin ng court yung case ko especially na mas madaming important cases. had i known, naghintay na lang ako ng taon. di ko naman ikakamatay na hindi makapagtravel sa work. pero di ko na nabawi pera ko. bumachi na si commissioner. i was so mad i even wished ill to her children. sabi ko sana sumakit tyan mga anak nya sa ipapakain nyang galing sa nakaw. that was my 1st experience of corruption. 2. i was flagged down by a traffic enforcer for beating the amber light. the traffic light turned from green to amber when i was literally in the middle of edsa shaw so tanga ko naman kung titigil ako sa gitna ng kalye. at nun lang ako nakarinig na beating the yellow light. di ba red. i told the police officer, ok. i was too tired to argue. he blatantly asked for money. eh gustuhin ko man, me sakit ako na palagi wala pera ang wallet coz this was the early days of eon so excited ako gumamit ng debit card. i showed him my wallet to insist na tiketan ako. he saw a bottle of wine in my car. back in the early 2000s, meron pang makro and i bought a bunch of wines na php 29 lang per bottle. binigay ko na yung cheap ass wine. i know mali ako kasi corruption pa rin yun and i contributed to it. my excuse is pagod na ako but then hindi pa rin yun excuse. 3. my experiences with the government started to get worse when i started doing business. i had a yoga business before and a city hall tried to purchase weekly classes. they told me to report a different price in the receipt. i pulled out the classes. 4. i have a small digital marketing agency. when we were starting, nagbigay ako ng free service e.g. free website development. target ko nun was 1 per industry. para lang ba magkaron ng laman yung portfolio. i approached a provincial government. the project was disapproved. remember, free ito. bakit ka tatanggi. incidentally, a friend was the head of a department at the kapitolyo. i asked her to ask why coz i needed to understand the rejection. i was told that because the service was free, walang pagkukunan ng lagay. so dapat nagoffer na lang daw ako ng may bayad para mapatungan nila. 4. sa digital marketing agency pa rin.. required na bumili ng fire extinguisher para makakuha ng fire permit. eh di bumili naman ako. nireject yung application ko kasi dapat daw eh yung accredited supplier ng fire department kahit na me napakalaking signage sa fire department na bawal silang magbigay ng pangalan ng supplier. again, patawarin nyo ako pero bumili ulit ako ng fire extinguisher and this time dun sa supplier ng fire department. 5. mas malala yung experiences ng friends ko na mas malaki ang businesses i have a ton of friends na entrepreneurs din kasi yun ang major namin. dahil hearsay, i will just give one example. a major government project now is reported 100x the actual price."

14126,X,"as i read in wikipedia, there is no visaya or bisaya language, but several visayan languages like cebuano, ilonggo, waray, etc. with the most widely spoken and prestigious being cebuano. wikipedia also says that although there is no visaya language, speakers of cebuano, ilonggo, etc. often refer to their language as visaya. however, i have met several people from the visayan region, and apart from those that speak waray, they almost always refer to their native language as visaya. i then ask if it is also called cebuano or ilonggo or hilygaynon they just look at me confused and say, no. visaya. i was able to get a hold of a book called my travel companion in the philippines by amado m. calderon, which translates more than 700 phrases into among others cebuano, waray, ilonggo, and visayan. the translations of visayan are close but often distinct from cebuano, ilonggo, and waray, which should all be visayan languages. note that inside the book visayan has changed to visaya or visayas. some examples the ninth cebuano ang ikasiyam visayas ang pansiyam ilonggo ikasiyam waray an ikasiyam the honey cebuano ang sugos visaya ang dugos ilonggo ang dugos waray matamis na bao shes a pretty girl. cebuano guwapa siya. visaya guawapa siya. ilonggo matahum siya nga babaye. waray mahusay hiya na babayi. call the police! cebuano tawaga ang pulis! visaya tawga ang pulis ilonggo magtawag sang pulis! waray tawag hin pulis i have lost my passport! cebuano nawala naku ang akong passport. visaya naduya ko ang akon passport. ilonggo nadula ko ang akon pasaporte. waray nawara an ahon pasa porte dont move! cebuano ayaw paglihok! visaya ayaw maghiwag ilonggo indi ka maghulag! waray ayaw hin kilwag so what is this visayanvisayasvisayabisaya language exactly? note that wikipedia lists 20 other bisayan languages baybayanon, kabalian, capiznon, romblomanon, bantayanon, porohanon, ati, masbateo, southern sorsogon, central sorsogon, cuyonon, caluyanon, aklanon, karaya, inonhan, ratagnon, asi, surigaonon, butuanon, and tausug"

14129,X,"lumaban, as never before, para sa bayan fight, as never before, for our country by solita collasmonsod inquirerdotnet philippine daily inquirer 0506 am november 13, 2021 nagkakagulo sa ating mundong pampulitika. natatandaan mo noong nabuo ang 1sambayan para pagisahin ang opposition laban kay pangulong duterte sa anumang anyo? pagkalaon, ang kanilang kandidato ay si leni robredo. ngayon naman, pinagiisa rin ni mr. duterte ang kanyang position, at nakikipagsundo siya kina marcos, romualdez, at arroyo lahat para matiyak na matalo si leni. ngayon ay apat na political dynasties mula luzon, visayas, at mindanao na nagkampi para kontrolin ang bansa. para pagtibayin ang kanilang alliance, mayroon pang suggestions na maghatian sila ng termino, na magbigayan sila ng executive powers sa bisepangulo, at na magalok ng official goodies kay isko moreno at manny pacquiao na dating tuta naman talaga kapalit ng pagwithdraw nila sa kandidatura o kapalit ng labanan nila si leni sa kanikanilang kampanya. wala naman sanang naging problema, alam mo, kung hindi tumakbo si leni. mapapakiusapan kasi ang ibang kandidato na alam ang galawang pulitika at na alam paano magpalit ng partido o ng panig kahit kailan. so tuloy na sana ang ligaya nila. pero ang pagpapangulo ni leni ay gamechanger. wala silang kontrol kay leni dahil hindi siya kailanman nasilaw ng pera. siyam na taon sa pulitika, at walang kotse, walang mansion, walang alahas, at sumasakay pa rin sa bus !. walang maiparatang sa kanya yumao na ang kanyang asawa magiging mabuting pangulo din si jesse robredo, at ayaw ng tatlong dalaga nya sa pulitika at droga. bukod dito, siya lang ang kandidatong may handson experience sa pagtulong sa mahihirap at marginalized. idagdag mo ang kanyang academic background economics at law. walang pagnanakaw, walang pandaraya, walang pinatay, walang kasinungalingan sa kanyang background. diyos ko, sabi nitong mga trapong ito kapag nanalo siya, magkakapangulo tayo na competent, propoor, incorruptible, at walang utang sa kaninong pulitiko! paano naku! kung pagkaraang makaranas ng 6 taon sa pamumunong ganito, mapagtanto ng mga tao na niloloko sila at ganito na ang gusto nila laging pangulo? saan tayo, mga dynasty at corrupt politicians, pupulutin? sa kangkugan. si leni ang transformative leader na kailangan ng bansa, at na ayaw ng mga pulitiko. hindi siya santo, oo, hindi naman niya sinabing santo siya. pero mukhang grounded ang kanyang faith, na sinusundan ng kanyang values at prinsipyo. siyempre, maaakit at maaakit pa rin, pero kumpara sa iba, mas matagal bago siya malugmok. iyan, mambabasa, ay bakit takot si mr. duterte sa kanya. tunay itong takot. tinanggal niya si leni sa kabinete bilang housing secretary pagkaraan ng wala pang anim na buwan. takot. footnote ayon huling statdev ng philippine statistics authority, hindi aabot sa targets ng philippine development plan 20172022 ang housing sector. naalala niyo noong humahagulgol si mr. duterte sa kabiguan ng kanyang antidrug program? inanyayahan niya si leni na maging drug czar, nagaakalang tatangihan ni leni, o mabibigo siya tulad niya. tinanggap ni leni, at sa sobrang transform ni leni sa antidrug forces gamit ng systematic at rational analysis ng problema at solusyon, tinanggal na naman ni duterte siya bilang drug czar just 19 days later. takot. ngayon pagisipan natin ang future ng pilipinas sa kamay ng apat na dynasties. tandaan ang background ng mga dynasties na ito pagkapit sa katungkulan, anumang mangyari sa bansa. lahat sa kanila, at least minsan, ay nagpamartial law. masasabing nasa dugo na nila. dalawa sa kanila ang sangkot sa droga at least gumamit ng droga, at dalawa ang kampi sa china. wag kalimutan ang corruption. rip philippines. at hindi lang yan. kapag aprubahan ng supreme court sa antiterrorism act, magagamit ito upang magkamartial law without declaring martial law. sa tutoo lang, ayon sa aking asawa, isang constitutional law expert, may provision ang ata na mas malubha at subject to abuse, gaya ng detention without a warrant of arrest for up to 24 days. hindi ito sinusulat, mambabasa, para kabahan ka at malungkot sa ating bukas. sinusulat ito para pagtibayin na kailangan nating lumaban, as never before, para sa bayan. solita_monsodyahoo.com"

14135,X,"pansensya na, minsan bali ang aking tagalog dugo ilong . ang aking nanay narecruit sa jeehovah witness. and while ill support my mom with anything that will make her genuinely happy, part of me thinks that shes only in it because it gives her a sense of belongingness. its also her only other way of socializing since shes been retired for years now. without being pushy of course, i want to share readings, quotes, videos, etc. that talk more about seeking guidance from mother earth, the universe, manifestation, angels.. like our ancestors, before precolonialism. pero im having a hard time finding any in tagalog, kung meron kayong mga links, paki please, send mo sa aakin salamat!"
14136,X,"what wil lbe your poriority legsilation during your term as senator? atty. agnes bailen mga kababayan ko kung ako po papalarin at mananalo bilnag isang senador ang magiging priority ki po ay i organize po ang ating beaurukrasya masyado na pong mabigat ang ating beaurucracy dahil ako po ay naka silbi po sa tatlong branches po ng government at nakita ko rin po na yung salaries standardization law ang sabi nga is a standardize pero po in due time marami po nag papa exempt so meron pong mga ahensya na mas nakaka lamang sa ibang mga ahensya so ang kailangan po talaga natin ayusin ang ating beaurucracy tapos marami po tayong mga ahensya na nag dodoble yung ibang ahensya temporary lang pero ayaw nilang mabuwag pero kailangan na kasi masyadong mabigat po ang ating bearukrasya at masyado pong magastos sa mga tax payers lalong lalong na po ngayong na pandemya nalaman po natin talaga kung ano ang essential at non essential goverment workers so ang unang gagawin ko itatanong ko po sa civil service sino ba yoong mga ahensya ano yung mga listahan kung sino yung mga nag wowork from home at sino po iyong mga pinapapasok nalaman ko rin po sa ating ahensya na mayroon pong mga trabaho like drivers po at ang mga mabababang mga empleyado na hindi po sila permanente ayon ang babaguhin ko po maraming salamat. atty. luke espirito magandang gabi sa lahat ang priority legislation ko ay buwagin ang lahat ng mga manpower agencies dahil walang silbi ang mga man power agencies sila ay mga linta, parasites extra layer lamang na walng silbi sa produksyon at sila ang dahilan kung bakit ang ating mga manggagawa natin ngayon ay nasasadlak sa kahirapan 70 ng mga ating manggagawa ay kontraktual sa ilalim ng man power agencies ang effect ng pagigiging kontraktual eh kahit gaano ka katagal sa iyong trabaho umabot ka man ng 10 years 15 years 20 years wala ka talagang ka pagapag asa sa buhay dahil sasabihin ng kumpanya kung saan ka nag tratrabaho sasabihin nya hindi ka manggagawa ng kumpanyang iyon ikaw may manggagawa ng man power agency anong effect non matatali ka sa minimum wage na hindi naman nakabubuhay masyadong mababa ang minimum wage natin dahil kumpari sa ating cost of living sa mga manggagawa na 1615 a day at hindi sila nakakapag union kaya hindi nila naitataas ang kanilang suweldo tapos wala silang karapatan sa security of tenure anytime puwede silang tanggalin kapag silay nag reklamo kapag silay nag organiza itong man power agency na ito in the mean time kumokubra ng bilyon bilyong piso sa pawis dugo ng manggagawa kahit wala siyang silbi pag akoy nanalo bilang senador huli na ang araw ng mga man power agency. carl balita bilang kaunaunahang nurse midwife po na tumatakbo isusulong ko ang omnibus positive practice environment act para sa mga health workers ito po ay hindi lamang tutugon sa kanilang pangangailangan sa suweldo at benepisyo itoy rin magbibigay sa kanila ng security of tenure ng magandang working condition at iyong tinatawag natin na career progression dahil nakabanta po ang imbetasyon para sa kanila na mag trabaho sa ibang bansa na napaka ganda ng mga offers at bilang nag iisang guro at doktor ng edukasyon nais ko pong tumawag ng edcom 2.0 na kung saan titignan po natin ang epekto ng edcom 1 nung 1990 titignan nating ang epekto ng k12 sa kagalingan ng ating mag aaral at titignan natin ang industry 4.0 na naging banta bago pa man dumating ang pandemya at syempre ang ating post pandemic education higit sa lahat kailangan makit natin ang suweldo ng mga guro sapagkat how do you attract the best and the brightest if their salaries not competitive especially not even in the asean but in the philippines as well at bilang entrepreneur guru at doktor ng humanities gusto ko pong itaguyod ang micro enterprise commission na kung saan ma eenable natin ang yung 89 na micro enterprises out of the 99.5 na msme at ma incentivise ang growth kung sila ay lalago at matulungan at ma integrate ang lahat ng serbisyong meron para sa kanila lalong lalo na ang puhunan. ibrahim albani in the name of god the most compassion and the most merciful kung po papalarin tayon ng diyos at tsaka ng sambayanang pilipino we have to create more job sa mga mamamayang pilipino kapagkat nakikita po natin dito walang trabaho ang lahat ng mga baranggay we will create a baranggay cooperativism and we will create a system because we firmly believe only the system that could discipline people so we have to urge the national goverment to download funds sa baranggay because the foundation of the government which is the baranggay if the baranggay is weak the administration is weak if the baranggay is strong the administration is strong and pangalawa ibabalik po natin we have to urge the goverment ibalik natin yung mga public facility sa sambayanang pilipino especially the infrastructure sa bansa natin because nakikita natin ngayon we are controlled by the oligarch kawawa ang sambayanang pilipino so ibalik natin katulad ng public utility the electricity pinaka mahal dito sa buong mundo which is the philippines at tsaka transportation at tsaka communication kailangan maibalik natin sa sambayanang pilipino pangalawa our country today are disunited the muslim are disunited christian are disunited and we have two big political party in our country and all our disunited so si albani im going to spark the unity and nationalic consolation sa bansa pagkat ito lamang ang susi sa tunay nag pag babago sa sambayanang pilipino sec. john castriciones and priority legislation ko po ay ang agrikultura alam po natin ang kahalagahan ng agrikultura sa pagkat ito po ang nag bibigay sa atin ng pagkain sa hapag kainan alam po natin we are an agricultural country 6070 of our population are actually engaged in agriculture but the irony of it all is up to now tayo po ay bumibili ng bigas sa ibang bansa what an irony several decades ago the people from our neighboring countries would come to the philippines in order to learn the ropes of plating palay pero ngayon tayo na po ang bumibili ng bigas sa kanila ganon din po ang bangus na dati rati po ay napaka sarap at nabibili lamang sa pangasinan ngayon po ay binibili na natin sa taiwan ang galunggong na kung saan itoy at pagkain ng masang pilipino binibili narin natin po ito sa china ibig sabihin napabayaan po ang agrikultara kaya kailangan po natin ng mga batas na magtataguyod at papaunlarin ang agrikultura agriculture is the backbone of our country we are an agricultural country ano ang gagawin nating kung napakaraming mahihirap na mamamayang pilipino kailangan po nating silang tulungan ito po ang nag uugnay sa insorhensya sa kanayunan kaya kailangan dapat nating paunlarin ang ating agrikultura alam po natin ayuda tulong lupa yan po ang kailangan ng ating magsasaka kung wala po ang magsasaka ang sabi natin sigurado magkakaroon tayo ng problema lalong lalo po ngayong panahon ng pandemya na kung saan tayo po lahat umaasa sa pagkain wala pong gamot ang pandemya ang kailangan po natin pagkain lupa para sa ating magsasaka yan po ang kailangan natin atty. leo olarte pag ako po ay papalarin na maging senador ang mga priority legislations ko po ay sa kalusugan bilang doktor ng medicina at abogado ako po ay gagawa ng batas na magpapahalaga sa kalusugan by establishing a research and development science center ito pong science center na ito ay mag mamanufacture research develop vaccines for infectious diseases katulad po ng pandemic omicron delta which is number 1 arch enemy and also medicines to prevent cancer and cancer po ang pinaka matinding kalaban ng mamamayang pilipino marami pong namamatay sa sakit na cancer high blood diabetes kailangan po natin magawa ito mga gamot na ito upang magagamit po natin at ang sobrang na mga gamot at bakuna na ito ay ibebentat natin sa ibang bansa number 2 po is the education bilang professor po ng batas at ng medisina po ang napansin po na itong mga kabataan po natin mga estudyante pag dating po sa unibersidad mag aaral po ng medisina at batas meron po silang kahinaan it will become mandatory for all parents to bring their children mula kindergarten hanggagn grade 6 sa eskuwelahan libre po ang ibibigay na almusal as an incentive po atty. salvador panelo ako po ay tumatakbo sa senado upang ituloy ang mga reporma na sinimulan ni presidente roa rodrigo duterte isang serbisyong malasakit at matapang ang pangarap ko ay pangarap ninyo gusto ko po na palagi ninyong iisipin at abutin ang mga pangarap ninyo sa inyong mga sarili at sa inyong mga anak ayon po sa ating saligang batas ang pangunahing tungkulin ng gobyerno ay mag silbi at magbigay ng proteksyon isusulong ko po sang ayon dito sa batas na ito ang palawigin pa at palawakin pa ang libreng eduksyon ang health at legal services bigyan ng 10000 allowance ang mga ina ng tahanan doblehin ang mga suweldo ng mga guro ang mga drivers ay bigyan ng ayuda ng gobyerno bigyan po sila ng subsidy iyong pong mga lgbtq na inaapi kailangang palakasin natin ang anti discrimination laws ang mga may sakit may kapansanan pwd kailangan bigyan din po natin ng proteksyon kasama na rin ang mga senior citizens dagdagan natin ang ayuda at ang pinaka mahalaga po sa atin sa ngayon yung mga special children kinakailangan po bigyan nating ng special education libre at therapy at kinakailangan po bigyan natin ng mga facilities ako po ay nakilala bilang taga pag tanggol ni pangulong duterte at itutuloy ko po iyan. atty. larry gadon ang isa sa mga pinaka malaking problema natin ngayon ng bansa ay ang pagka wala ng trabaho while the employment rate of 92.2 in 2021 looks good at ang employment rate natin ay 7.8 karamhian dito ay panandaliang trabaho lamang sapagkat ito ay nag laan ang gobyerno nf 40 billion pesos para doon sa programa natupad at duon sa gip at tsaka yung tulong panghanap buhay pero panandalian ito ang kinakailangan natin dito ay mga permanenteng trabaho at kinakailangan natin ng micro industrialization na magtatayo maghihikayat tayo ng mga negosyante at mga investors na magtayo ng mga maliliit na factories mga pabrika sa mga bayanbayan upang matugunan ang pag kawala ng trabaho at sa rice shortage naman sa food security hindi totoo na meron tayong rice shortage kung masusunod ang kung i momodernize natin ang ating post harvest system mag mula sa pag papatuyo ng palay at sa pag giling mayron pa tayong surplus ng 3 at yan ay dapat nating bigyan ang rice delears association ng malaking tulong bigyan sila ng loan na kanila namang mababayaran hindi sila maka utang sa bangko dahil sari sari store operation sila pero kapag minomodernize natin magkakaroon tayo ng rice efficiency loren legarda bilang chariman ng senate commitee on finance sa unang tatlog taon ng duterte administration nakatulong po tayo sa pag pondo sa maraming magagandang programa ni pangulong duterte nakikita ko po na kailangan natin para sa pandemic recovery is economic empowerment of every filipino family kaya po yong pangkabuhayan law gaya po ng dole pangkabuhayan dti shared services facilities dole tupad ang ating dosts ibat ibang mga dswd sustainable livelihood program must be institutionalized para po even after the duterte administration mag katrabaho at makaroon po ng kabuhayan ang mga nangangailangan for pandemic recovery pangalawa po yong one tablet one student act 26million po ang ating deped learners na wala pong sariling gadgets ito poy kailangan din ng mga estudyante sa suc 1.6milliion 80 billion pesos lang po ang kailangan sa 5trillion budget bilang chariman ng senate committee on finance alam ko po kailangan gawin ito at kaya pong gawin ako po ay nagagalak na makatulong sa pag enact ng free college education universal health care law during the duterte administration nakikita ko po kailangan pa pong pa igtingin especially ang universal health care para sa pag roll out ng health care programs salamat po cong. rodante marcoleta pandagdag po sa maraming nagawang programa ng administrasyon ni pangulong duterte kailangan po nating maibaba ang singil ng kuryente sa ating bansa sa pagkat ito po ang layunin ng batas na ito ay ginawa 21 taon na ang nakararaan ito po ay magbibigay ng sigla sa ating manufacturing sector kung saan darami po ang trabaho at pag marami po ang trabaho ay maiibsan po ang kahirapan ng marami nating mga kababayan pag sisikapan po din natin na ayusin ang problema ng bumagsak na kalidad ng public education kailangan po nating ma restructre yung k12 curriculum ilagay po natin lahat diyan ang mga best practices ng mga bansang katulad ng finland ng japan at ng singapore sapagkat tayo ay namumunuhan sa mga kabataan ng ating bansa kagaya po natin ng sinabi kanina kailangan nating palakasin ang productivity ng agriculture sector mayaman ang ating bansa mayaman ang lupa mahirap po ang magsasaka malawak ang karagatan ngunit kailangan pa nating mag importa ng isa kailangan din po nating tutukan ang lumalalang problema ng corruption ang commission on audit po ay kailangan gamitin natin para bantayan ma prevent ang corruption hindi para mag ulat lamang ng mga anumalya at pangungulimbat na ginagawa yan po ay gagawin natin sa maraming pagkakataon kapag tayo po ay naluklok sa senado atty. harry roque dalawang bago po dalawang luma unang una po ipagtataguyod parin natin ang kalusugan bilang nag sulong po ng unviersal health care sa mababang kapulungan alam ko po ang pinaka malaking banta sa tagumpay ng universal health care ay ang corruption diyan sa philhealth kaya pinag aaralan ko na po ang pag bubuwag ng phil health pag papalit po ng national health service para ito po ay isang paraan na matanggal ang mga kurap jan sa philhealth at makinabang ang taong bayan sa universal health care nandiyan din po yung pag bubuo ng isang bagong ietf na ang composition ay hindi lang po mga doctor kundi mga negosyante mga economist mga sociologist para nagkaroon po ng bagong pandemya maiiwasan po ang pag ka guton and at the same time maiiwasan din po ang pag kalat ng sakit kinakailangan din pong isulong natin ang ating naihain na na 0 hunger bill itigil na po ang kagutuman sa pilipinas sa loob ng 6 na taon at ang right to water bill magbibigay na po tayo ng sapat malinis na inuming pantubig para sa lahat ng pilipino at nandiyan din po siyempre yung dati ko ng pinag lalaban yung freedom of information bill at tsaka yung whistle blowers act dahil yung mga kaso po gaya ng extrajudicial killings at ang mga corruption napaka hirap po yan approbahan sa korte ng wala po tayong binibigyan ng incentives sa mga whistle blowers o yung mga kasangkot na hindi naman pinakanagkakasala na magbigay ng testimonya syempre po nandiyan din ang ating proteksyon na dapat ibigay sa mga mamamahayag kung ano yung benipisyong binigay natin sa mga testigo kapag may banta sa buhay ibigay din po natin sa mga mamamahayag"

14251,X,"hi, speaking for a close friend here. shes graduating this semester. sya ang bunso and the only one na naka pagcollege sa family nya. knowing her family, hirap talaga sila magpaaral lalo na sa college. there were some scholarships she considered, most were unfortunate, some have ridiculous maintaining grades e.g., 95. dalawang kapatid nya ang tumulong sa kanya, yung una from 1st 2nd year college. kapatid nya yun sa unang pamilya ng mother nya. tumulong sya para daw may magahon sa hirap nung current family ng mother nila. pangalawa is yung kapatid naman nya mismo sa current family, from 3rd 4th year college naman tumulong. ang gusto naman nitong kapatid nya is mag bigaybigay na lang daw sa ipapagawang bahay nya to lessen the burden. as of now namanhikan na last year yung unang tumulong, yung isa naman is naghahanap na ng mapapangasawa. afford naman na nilang buhayin ang sarili nila kahit magpamilya na sila kaso ang tanong ko lang is may obligasyon ba talaga ang friend kong tumulong pabalik? stress na sya from time to time dahil kailangan daw na nyang magkawork. plus kailangan pa daw nyang tubosin yung lupa nila na naka sangla. any advice i should give her?"
14259,X,"siguro napansin ko lang kasi of course parte din yung tumatanda tayo pero kahit nga yung ibang matatanda eh meron pa ring spirit of christmas pero parang hindi na siya tulad ng dati na everyone can participate ng masayang christmas. parang in the past 3 years sobrang nag iba yung spirit of christmas like wala na masyadong nangangaroling na bata or masyadong late na nagdedecor yung mga kaptibahay mo. before pandemic laging may party sa mga kapitbahay pag pasko, bawat bahay ang iingay. same with decorations parang ang cheap na tignan ng mga christmas lights compared dati na sobrang ganda ng colors. idk maybe post pandemic just ruined everything."
14261,X,"im in a creative mood so i thought of writing a short story. mga anito ng maynila sa may simbahan ng binondo nakatingin ang babae sa kalesa at sa kabayo na nakapwesto sa harap ng simbahan ng binondo. may maliit na ngiti sa gilid ng kanyang labi. sakay kayo? tanong ng kutsero sa babae. di ko akalaing makakita ako ng ganito dito. sabi ng babae. konti na nga lang mga kalesa dito sa maynila. kung gusto nyo ng ikot lang pwede na ang tatlong daan, pa gabi na din kasi. salamat, pero di ko po sila kayang sakyan. dalawang daan? salamat pa rin po. tumango ang kutsero at bumalik sa panonood sa kanyang cellphone. hanapin mo ako. bulong ng babae sa kabayo bago maglakad pa alis. sa isang murang hotel sa soler st. nag ring ang telepono sa room 314. mam, may lalaki po dito hinahanap kayo. paki patuluyin mo sa kwarto ko. bukas yan ang sagot ng babae pagka katok sa kanyang pinto. nakita mo ang ilaw ng kandila? tumango ang mama. pwede ba? tanong ng lalaki nung binunot nya ang pakete ng fortune. humindi ang babae at tinuro ang nosmoking sign sa kwarto. nagulat ako nung nakita kita kanina, di ko inakalang may kagaya mo dito sa siyudad. at di ko din inakalang may manananggal na bibisita sa siyudad at tumabi pa sa simbahan. walang epekto ang simbahan sa akin, taga pangaalaga pa nga ako ng mga santo sa amin. kung alam lang ng mga tao dun. tumingin tingin ang lalaki sa kwarto. may kandilang itim na naka sindi sa maliit na lamesa at may maleta na may sticker ng cebu pacific na galing tagbilaran sa sahig. galing ka ng bohol? sa loon. nakita ko ang pangalan mo sa kalesa. richard nga ba ang pangalan mo? tumango ang lalaki. ako si avelina pero lina na lang itawag mo sa akin ano ang pakay mo dito? hinahanap ko si bathala. di na sya ang bathalang tulad ng dati. nandito nga sya? kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya? nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko. sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo. bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alasonse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. malayo ba sya? walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin. sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 711 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. matagal ka na dito sa maynila? mga tatlumpung taon na. alam ng kutsero kung ano ka? oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa. meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon. ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad. di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo. araguy! napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin. di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang akala mo lang, tikbalang malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo. tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. pamparegla gamot sa eksema mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. sya ang hinahanap mo sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo. bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka. sabi ni richard. meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo. ano ang sakit mo? at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo. naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin. natawa si bathala. nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kayat wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilanngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to. alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling. kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo. salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala. at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko. sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako. kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin. sino?

14278,X,"okay, so since i live near divisoria, there are a couple of encounters both good and bad. i decided ill share it here on reddit. heres one of my encounters today, may 3, 2023 around 715pm galing ako sa gym sa lucky chinatown at bago ako umuwi, dumaan muna ako sa mercury drug ng dragon 8 mall para bumili ng rite n lite. kumuha na ko ng 4 cans of rite n lite at nakisuyo sa cashier na ilalapag ko muna yung items since iikot pa ko at may kukunin pang ibang items. konti lang kasi yung cucumber flavor so sinecure ko na sa cashier area haha. anyway, andon ako sa snacks aisle tapos sakto merong dalawang ateghorl in their late 40s to mid 50s na kumuha ng redbull pack of 2s sa ref. nasa likod galing yung redbull tapos dahil sa pagkuha nila, merong isang bote ng redbull na nalaglag at nabasag. hindi sa sahig nabasag yung bote, sa loob sya ng ref nahulog. kitangkita ko, nagtinginan sila at isinara lang yung ref. naisip ko, baka babayaran din naman nila sa cashier at magsasabi sila na para malinis din yung area. tuloy lang ako sa pagkuha ng items na kailangan ko tapos pumila na rin ako after a while. sakto, sila ateghorl yung nasa harapan ko. nung sila na magbabayad, nilapag lang nila yung redbull pack of 2s tapos naglapag ng 500 pambayad. hindi nila sinabi na may nabasag sila at mukang wala na ring balak. i dont usually speak up dahil ayoko maging epal at di ako mahilig sa confrontations. siguro nga ang pabida ko pero nung nakita ko talagang wala sila plan magbayad sa nabasag nila, i bravely said, excuse me ate. yung nabasag nyo po. tapos sumagot yung ateghorl na isa na blonde. huh? anong nabasag? sa isipisip ko, luh parang tanga. ano daw nabasag ampotah hahaha ayun po oh, sabay turo sa ref tanaw sa cashier area, yung bote po na andon sa baba ng ref huh may nabasag pala kami?, maangmaangan ni ateghorl at this point, naalert na yung guard at yung bagger. lumapit yung bagger dun sa ref and nakita nya yung remnants nung basag na bote. pinakita ng cashier yung basag na bote dun sa mga ateghorl at sinabi na ippunch na daw nya. sige babayaran ko yan, sabi ni ateghorl na blonde. and im like, aba dapat lang? tapos bigla nya hinawakan yung isang rite n lite cucumber ko at sinabing ano to? isama mo na to babayaran ko rin ay ate, akin po yan. nilapag ko lang dyan sa cashier kasi may iba pa kong kinuha, sabat ko pagkatapos nila magbayad may binubulongbulong silang dalawa pero di ko na narinig. nung turn ko na magbayad, super nagtthank you sakin yung guard, cashier, at bagger. hindi ko alam kung dahil ba sa sahod nila ibabawas yung mga ganung cases. nakakairita lang kasi, una, hindi sila naging accountable. pangalawa, nag maangmaangan sila as if ako pa yung nagsisinungaling. tapos pangatlo, they didnt even bother na magreport sa staff para malinis yung area. bottle yung nabasag, may chance na may bubog or tibo or whatever na pdeng makasugat sa ibang customers. for the record, 30php lang ang redbull at 500php ang ibinayad nila. para sa 30php tatakas sila sa liability nila? what if sa staff yun pinapabayaran. siguro sa iba, 30php is not that much. pero for minimum wage earners, malaking bagay na sa kanila yun. sabi rin naman ni kuya guard, narinig nyang may nahulog pero di nya na pinansin dahil isinara naman daw agad yung ref so inassume nya na wala namang nabasag or something. ayun lang, marami pa kong isshare na divi encounters sa susunod hahaha edit removed the j word since ang daming umiiyak sa comment. nag describe lang eh."

14289,X,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons kapre, tikbalang aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of precolonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwandrop your stories here narinig man or naexperience about these creatures of the night."

14310,X,"first of all, i was inspired by this post sa post nito, andame nagsasabe sa comments na ang homophobic raw ng straight guys. i argue otherwise in my experience, honestly lang, alam ko ang weird and napakacounterintuitive pero mas madame akong kilalang homophobes na straight females kesa sa straight males. crazy, right???!! sobrang dameng beses ko na naencounter yung mga babaeng nagsasabe na omg ang gwapo naman. sayang bakla pala. and ano ba yan andame nang mga bakla. konti nalang mga tunay na lalake sa panahon ngayon. need i remind you, hindi porket goodlooking or attractive yung isang tao, hindi sila obliged orand hindi entitled mga babae na maging straight yung mga taong yun. subtly napansin ko lanv all over the years kasi ever since elementary ko pa to naririnig, ngayon ko lang narealize na napakahomophobic pala ng statements na yan again these come from girls. not men. another example is naooverhear ko lang sa arguments between girls and gays are that pagnatatalo sa usapan yung straight girls, final card nila is bakit? tunay na babae ka ba? and similar lines. again, wala ako pake. hindi ko kasalanan naooverhear ko arguments nila sa classroom or in public pero ngayon ko lang din narealize, parang sobrang taas ng tingin ng mga females just because of their gender and thus homophobic. andame ko din neighbors and friends of relatives na napakastraight up ang baba ng tingin and diring diri sa mga gay people. one female friend of a relative of mine once said derogatory remarks sa gay tito namin nung may party a few years ago. isa ko pang babaeng classmate na religious noong senior high school sabe hindi ko matandaan exact words lalake ka talaga, sis. pagnarealize mo sa bible and pag narinig mo calling ni god, malalaman mo na hindi totoo mga bakla. or something ganun. also, this female classmate rin nagsabe ng ay hindi ka marunong magbasketball? hindi ka naman barbie bakla? like holy shit. and am very aware that other female pinays think like this, given our upbringing as filipinos. so it may seem like straight females pa ang mas sympathetic sa lgbt community at first glance, it isnt always the case. lahat ng straight guys na kakilala ko either walang pake sa mga gay guys and may isa pa nga ako kakilala na hes a straight guy pero halos.. tinatantsa ko lang btw halos 70 ng friends nya ay gay guys or straight girls. although, had to admit, nung high school and elem gays, mas critical ang boys sa lgbt community. pero after high school pag dating sa shs, college or pag way past 18 na, i realized parang on the inside mas homophobic filipino women kesa sa filipino men. ayun lang po, have a good day. edit another one last year, may argument sa facebook and one girl said, mukha ba kong papatol dyan? tingin nyo magpapakntot ako dyan? mukha ngang paminta yan. edit i can give more examples if yall want. and plus, handa ako madownote to oblivion and maban ako from rph just for speaking the truth based on my experience. its one of my principles to speak truthfully kahit na hindi angkop sa society na im living in."

14316,X,"kailangan mo ba talaga magdala ng yearbook? from diy travel philippines group hi, im posting again as promised. been with the bureau for a decade now, been assigned to different ports as well. disclaimer everything you will read in this post are all about my personal experiences sa counter. youre free to compare me from ios you have encountered, but i will not engage in negative comments or bashing. also, you cannot use this post as basis na ma clear kayo sa immig counters because everything will be based on the totality of circumstance on the day of your travel. also sa mga ios na makakabasa neto, bahala na kayo to check on yourselves. this is how i perform my job. youre welcome to make this a big deal, raise your eyebrows, shrug or follow some of my procedures. hahaha whichever. so here comes nothing! first time travelers 1. dress comfortably and appropriately. why? because yes, your attire matters. judgemental talaga kami, guys. hindi ko naman nilalahat comfortably yung parang mag chichill ka lng with friends shirt, jeans, sneakers, perhaps a jacket bsta hindi yung prang rarampa ka sa stage or mag didinner with heart e. avoid heels, pls. nakakapagod tumakbo sa airport especially pag final call na. a legit or frequent traveller knows this kaya mostly, nka flats yan cla or sneakers. approriately means, nka depende to sa country of destination mo. example, singapore yung ticket mo, pero destination mo talaga is dubai and ayaw mong malaman to ni io. pero kasi, december alis mo, winter sa dubai, mej malamig, nka jacket ka na may furfur. char. eh hndi namin malamig sa singapore. so ma ooffload ka just because of the jacket? diba? do the math. pro tip pag 1st time to travel abroad, book like a 3d2n trip muna then bring a 1015kg of clothes. iwasan muna ang change outfit na mga 100 times. bcs the heavier your luggage is, the more suspish you become. the shorter your travel dates, the more legit you look as a tourist. 2. if traveling alone, sa queue pa lng, take slow and paced breaths. calm down, stop checking your phone every minute. why? kasi kaming mga officers, even though we conduct inspections in an enclosed counters, we are particular of the demeanor ng mga na sa pila namin. we profile you kahit na sa queue ka pa lng. everything, from your shoes, to your bags up to how you behave yourself. we dont do this to outbound filipinos alone, we also do the same strategy sa mga foreigners coming in. also, if you keep on checking your phone, i have this presumption na may kausap ka for instructions. usually kasi, mga victims ng human trafficking, may kausap yan, coaching them every step of the way hanggang makalusot sa counter. if i see you fidgeting with your phone, i already have a prejudice towards you. refer kita for secondary inspection. also, using of electronic devices is prohibited sa immigration area. if traveling with a group, queue properly. wag mag chismis sa pila or talk too loud because you are contributing to the noise pollution around you. and yung strangers na kasabay nyo sa pila, naiingayan din sa inyo. hahaha 3. do not, i said, do not place your printed docs sa plastic or brown envelop tapos hahawakan nyo. no. please dont. put all your documents inside your bag. hindi kayo mag aapply ng work, i personally dont want to see a legit tourist na may hawak na envelop. huhu that envelop for me is already a screaming red flag. and pag may need ka eabot sa officer, remove it from any concealed envelop. kasi baka may pera ka na naiwan sa loob and the officer might feel insulted with it, baka akalain bribe money. 4. while nka pila, just hold your passport, remove mo yung passport jacket ksi it wont fit in our scanners. and may mga nahuhulog from your jacket inserts tapos kasalanan pa namin pag nawala.nkklk anyway, hold your passports, insert your departure card and your boarding pass in any page of your passport, kng may visa ka, dun mo einsert na page. at yan lng ang ibigay mo pag dating mo sa counter ni io. nothing more, nothing less. pag may hinanap sayo, dats the time you present your printed docs or ids. pag hindi, do not proactively present. 5. re phone check we are legally armed and protected to do this. your rights to privacy is suspended sa borders, whether outbound or inbound. personally for me, hanggang convo and pictures lang ako. and i dont do the scrolling and never ko hinahawak ang phone. i would ask the passenger to do the scrolling, photo gallery, convo. i dont check bank accounts, i am a bit uncomfortable with the thot of checkin peoples money. and tbh, wala akong kakilala or nakasabay na officer on my shift that checks online bank accounts. printed, yes meron, kasi embassies also ask for bank statements, if we apply for visas. and those saying na may printed copies naman bakit mag checheck pa ng email. well, you wouldnt believe what people can fraudulently do just to present coes. or fabricate company ids pra mapaniwala kami na employed siya dito. 6. for males specifically. disclaimer this is my personal discretion. lets say, your profile is a family man, meaning, you have a wife and kids here in ph, youre traveling alone for a holiday. or to just visit a family member abroad, you think maniniwala kami? mag eenjoy ka kaya without your family with you? our initial judgement will be, you will work there. and there is nothing wrong with that. pro tip when the officer asks you the reason for travel, and kung totoo naman talaga dat you have a relative abroad within 4th degree, you can say that you will visit the relative and say at kung may mahanap na trabaho po dun, baka may chance po na mag tatrabaho dun i am not saying this will guarantee you can get thru that counter, but i personally appreciate an honest answer and i will gladly stamp your passport knowing you are doing what it takes for your family. hindi namin kami heartless, guys. p.s i only apply this to male travelers but never to females. why? because women and children, as study shows, are more prone to human trafficking incidents. thats reality. this is not discrimination. and i stand firm on this kasi hindi ko kinaya when i encountered an abused filipina who was sent home from saudi. hindi sya makausap ng matino as in sobrang traumatic nangyari sa kanya. she pretended to be a tourist bound for hk but jumped to ksa, instead. for previously offloaded 1. bring as much as possible yung hiningi ng io sayo when you were offloaded. dont simply base your experience with someone elses kasi hndi talaga kayo 100 the same situation. even sa akin, minsan, i would vouch for a friend na aalis ng bansa, may times na napapayagan, meron ding times na hindi talaga. and halos the same lng naman ang situation, it so happened na by the book c io, meaning kung ano yung rules, the officer sticks and adheres to it kasi yun naman talaga ang dapat. may times lng na kagaya ko na mejo relaxed yung approach sa rules, maybe it goes with age or tagal sa work. depende. but you know, everything happens for a reason. for freelancers i wouldnt mind if you dont have your itr, whats important are your ticket hotel booking coe with compensation simple itinerary, yung gawa mo for family traveling together immediate family only for example father, mother, kids, you may queue in one counter. isama mo na lng din or paunahin mo na yung grandparents then you stand behind them. yung kapatid mo na may sariling, pamilya, hayaan mong mag queue din separately. pero kng magisa lng sya, den by all means, isabay mo. hold all passports together tas before mo ibagay sa officer, ask mo muna kung okay lng na buong angkan nyo ang magpapa clear sa kanya. were usually not that strict pag family. pro tip if previously offloaded ka, malaki ang possibility na makakaalis ka if kasama mo family mo. of course, youll be interviewed again just so may mailagay kmi sa system to justify your travel, pero 90, goods ka na. kaya, isama ang buong pamilya pra masaya! i have seen a comment pala na nonsense dw ang question ni io na bakit doon ang punta mo? referring to the country of destination. this is answerable by either, you have family there, youre meeting a friend, you wanted to see a spot youve seen in a movie, you wanted to try something na sikat dun sa country. diba? possibilities are endless. so dont be sarcastic and say on your mind na eh dun gusto ko eh, pakialam mo ba. we would ask this to gauge your knowledge of the place youre supposed to visit. paano pala kung singapore yung ticket mo tapos gusto mo mag disney land? eh universal studios lng meron cla dun. nasa hk ung dl. if may friend ka na io, if kaclose mo talaga, message mo na before your flight hindi kami manghihingi ng pasalubong, pramisssss at kung legit nman tlaga na mag totour ka lng.. wag na wag ka mag mimessage asking for help pag na offload ka na kasi yung record mo nasa system na, hassle makipag usap just to clear your records, guys. hindi lahat ng nasa airport ay taga bureau of immigration, so if you have bad experience with other employees, wag nyo namin kami eblame just because kami yung last na nakausap nyo. be courteous and respectful at all times. we appreciate those mababait na passengers and wellmannered kasi marami talaga ang rude and feeling entitled. well, it goes both ways din nman. meron din mga ios na ganto. share it to help more peeps. save this post as well. enjoy your travel."
14317,X,"story time uso sa fb yung mga ganito eh may parent na pumunta sa school kanina asking kung pwede kami magproduce ng school id. since pandemic kase di na kame nakapagrelease, if need ng proof ng bata na officially enrolled sya sa school certificate of enrolment ang binibigay. need daw kase ni mother para sa scholarahip ng anak. hiningi namen ang details ng bata just to find out na hindi enrolled si bagets for this school year. nakikiusap talaga sya kase yun daw ang kailangan na requirements according kay governor na first hand niyang nakausap sana all close kay gob. we tracked the records ni bagets from grade 7, kase pwede naman daw yung id ng grade 7. so tinanong namen if nasaan yung id noong grade 7? ang sabe nawala na daw hindi na daw alam. tinry kong iexplain kay mother sa abot ng pangunawa niya na wala kaming maiproproduce kase 1. wala na samen ang layout ng id at isang beses lang kame magproduce every year. 2. hindi kami ang huling school na pinagaralan ng bata. 3. hindi enrolled ang bata for the school year. sa sobrang desperado ni mother, baka daw pwedeng makahingi ng proof na nagaaral ang bata, promise daw niya ieenrol niya ang anak niya next school year. pinarating ko to sa registrar and sabe yung bagets daw ay galing na sa school last week asking if pwede pang magenrol. dzai! nasa end of the school year na kame ngayon ka palang mageenrol? yung bagets ay may anak na. part ng tumubo at lumalang teenage pregnancy sa bayan namen simula noong pandemic. hindi naman sa ayaw syang bigyan ng karapatan na makapagaral pero paano na if facetoface na? okay lang hindi pumasok kase given na may inaalagaan syang bata? okay lang na ipasa sya at patuloy na makatanggap ng scholarship kase may handicap ka? ang conclusion namen, gusto lang makatanggap ng pera ni mother katulad ng sa 4ps. maganda ang layunin ng 4ps pero kulang na kulang tayo sa pagpapatupad at pagpili ng mga beneficiaries. may mga magulang na hindi sa pagaaral inilalaan ang perang nakukuha dito. karamihan sa mga 4ps beneficiaries ay wala talagang pakiaalam sa pagaaral ng anak. maalarma lang sila kapag nababawasan na ang nakukuha nilang pera, dahil minamarkahan na hindi pumapasok ang kanilang anak. lalapit lamang sila sa paaralan kapag alam na nilang babagsak na ang anak nila at mawawalan ng supporta galing sa gobyerno. ang madalas nilang sabihin sa mga guro maam 4ps po kase ang anak ko. mawawalan po siya ng pantustos sa pagaaral kapag binagsak. pero sila yung nga magulang na laging nagtatago sayo kapag hinohomevisit dahil madalas absent ang mga anak. sila yung mga nanay na hindi tumatayo sa sugalan para kausapin ang mga guro. sasabihan ka pa nila ng mam, magantay po kayo, hindi pa po ako bumibinggo. sila yung kahit halos kagatin ka ng aso hindi ka pa din lalabasin ng bahay nila. kaya minsan naiisip ko, hindi lahat ng mahihirap dapat tululungan ng gobyerno. hindi dapat lahat ng mahihirap binibigyan ng ayuda kase mas natutunan nilang maging tamad at pabuhat sa mga nagtatrabaho."
14318,X,im thinking of buying my first apple watch probably series 6 or se 1st or 2nd gen. do you think buying it in greenhills will be worth it? theyre a lot cheaper kasi compared to pmc or btb. halos kapresyo lang ng 2nd hand. any thoughts?
14320,X,"merry christmas! shared my australia migration story at rphmigrate. so far been receiving a lot of dms and questions. posting it here also to inspire other dreamers. i flew to australia last october through a student visa. im taking up masters with a post study work visa after graduation. hopefully 3 to 5 years pr na. unahin ko siguro yung cons. cons malaking investment sya tbh. it took my 5 years worth of savings para mabayaran yung tuition and magtabi ng living expenses. nakakalonely at times. dont get me wrong i have extended family here so maswerte naman. but iba yung warmth ng sama sama yung pamilya sa pinas. esp now na christmas. i swear totoo yung kanta, iba talaga ang pasko sa pinas haha. sobrang daming pros for me so far i learned so much about myself the past 3 months. sa bahay dati lumaki akong sobrang dependent and privileged, uupo nalang ako at kakain. nalabhan na lahat, dinadrive and sundo pa ko kung saan. comfortable naman. pero dito, ikaw lahat. malalaman mong kaya mo naman pala. kaya mo palang magluto basta sundan mo sa youtube, kakayanin mo pala maglaba magisa kasi kung hindi wala kang susuotin. kakayanin mong makipagkaibigan sa strangers. yes it gets lonely. pero use technology to your advantage. one click lang matatawagan mo na mga parents at mga kaibigan mo. yung part time service job, nakakapagod man pero maayos yung kita. magaan lang yung school load kaya kayang isabay. sa totoo lang halos same lang kinikita ko as full time sa pinas. bale dito min wage is nasa 420 aud weekly, so 60k php monthly equivalent. 20 hours of work lang yun ha. samantalang sa work ko dati, kulang nalang matulog ako sa office audit pero ung kita ko 13 lang nyan 20k. sobrang healing sa mental health nung pakiramdam na hindi ka masstress sa traffic, sa public transpo. sobrang daming parks and public spaces na pwedeng tambayan sa free time. hindi mo kailangan gumastos para lang makapaglibang. sa pinas prepandemic puro mall lang kami para makapagbonding. madaming pinoy communities dito. nakakabawas ng homesickness. sumali ka lang sa mga fb groups, madaling makakahanap ng crowd. anyway, maiksing panahon palang ako nandito. pero so far wala pa kong naranasang racism. sana ganto lang. last tip siguro bago ka lumipad, maglista ka ng lahat ng dahilan mo bakit ka lilipad at makikipagsapalaran. tuwing mahirap, balikan mo at basahin. makakahugot ka ng lakas pag finocus mo yung priorities mo at inalala bakit mo to sinubok in the first place. para sa kinabukasan laban, mga kaibigan!"
14322,X,"primer image alam niyo ba na lahat ng tao may sogie? ano nga ba ang sogie? acronym ito na ang ibig sabihin ay... s sex as in biological, base sa ari nang ipinanganak tayo female, male, intersex. akma rin ang paggamit ng assigned gender at birth agab dito assigned female at birthafab, assigned male at birthamab o orientation base sa romantic ato sexual attraction natin straight, gay, lesbian, etc. heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc. gi gender identity base sa pansariling pagkakakilanlan ayon sa kasarian o gender selfidentity cisgender magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity cisgender male agab identifying as a man afab identifying as a woman gender fluid nagiiba depende sa panahon, puwedeng tumutugma, puwedeng hindi tumutugma transgender hindi magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity trans woman amab identifying as a woman, afab identifying as a man, afmab identifying as nonbinary nonbinary puwedeng halong man at woman, puwedeng wala e expression panlabas na pagpapakita masculine, feminine, or androgynous sa gitna ang sogie, puwedeng halohalo puwede kang maging cisgender straight male presenting as feminine, puwedeng maging gay transman presenting as androgynousfeminine. oo, medyo mahirap intindihin minsan, pero ang pagparse layunin nang paghiwalay ng s, o, gi, at sa e ay upang tulungang intindihin ang mga tao na hindi tumutugma sa typical o tradisyunal na kaalaman upang intindihin ang kanilang sarili o ang ibang tao. besides, mas bihira ang magkakahalong sogie, pero kung may maencounter tayo na halohalo, maskaya nating intindihin kung matandaan mo ang sogie. madalas nating naririnig o mababasa na hindi totoong babae ang transwoman, masbihira ang panawagan na hindi totoong lalake ang transman. bakit? sa aking kaalaman, hindi magkahiwalay ang sex at gender identity sa ating mga wika. sa tagalog, pasok sa salitang kasarian ang sex at gender. kaya maiintindihan din natin kung bakit may ganitong kalituhan. pero, hindi naman natin ipagkakaila na malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa kulturang pilipino. ginamit ko as example ang wikang tagalog, pero sa filipino, pasok ang salitang gender sa wikang ito. malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa atin, wag natin ito ipagkaila parte na ito ng kulturang pilipino. pero, may sariling atin din tayo tulad ng bakla na puwedeng tumukoy sa homosexual ato transwoman may sarili tayong mga salita at kultura na tumutukoy sa sogie na iba sa banyaga. hindi ito black or white na dapat pumili tayo sa banyaga o sa lokal na pagkakaintindi, puwedeng gumawa ng hybrid na pagkakaintindi dito. useful naman ang sogie framework, parte na rin naman ang kulturang bakla sa kulturang pilipino. puwede natin palaganapin ang consciousness ukol sa gender kapag magawan ng paraan para magamit ang mga ito. ano ang issue sa gender identity? balikan natin ang issue sa transmanwoman. ang sinasabi ng iba, hindi babae ang transwoman. iklaro natin na hindi female ang transwoman, oo, never silang magiging female a male cannot be female. but a male can identify as woman. paano? pagtuunan natin ng pansin ang identity. magimagine tayo ng baller o mahilig sa basketball, may mabubuo tayong mga imahe na hindi magkakalayo sa isatisa. magimagine tayo ng skater, ng coffee lover, ng artist, ng rocker, ng car enthusiast, ng kung anuano pa. may nabubuo rin tayong imahe ng kanilang lifestyle na tumutukoy sa kanilang pananamit, mga gawain, kilos, atbp. sa baller, maiimagine natin na naglalaro at mahilig silang manuod ng basketball up to date sa mga events ng nba at kung ano pa. may ibaiba tayong imahe ng mga identity na ito, pero valid lahat ng interpretation natin sa mga ito. wala namang may authority para sabihin hindi ka ganito. isipin natin si pacquiao, ano ang imahe natin sa kaniya? boxer, pulitiko ????. pero diba mahilig rin siya mag basketball? pero nang subukan niya maglaro, pinagtatawanan siya ng mga tao. hindi ka basketbolista! sa boxing ka na lang!. hindi ka bagay sa basketball isa pa, extreme example naman. isang tao na pinanganak na may congenital issue kaya physically hindi siya puwede magskate. pero gustonggusto niya maging skater. nagdadamit siya na akma sa pagkakaintindi niya ng skater at sumusunod sa mga balita at tumatambay siya sa mga nagsskate. matatawag ba natin siyang skater kahit na hindi niya kaya magskate? kung may mahirap na mahilig sa kape, dinalaw ng kaibigan na mahilig rin sa kape. nadismaya nang nakita na percolator lang ang gamit niya. pano mo nasabing enthusiast ka kung ganiyan lang kape mo?. ang tawag dito, gatekeeping may standards ang mga tao na sila rin lang ang may gawa at kung hindi ka pasok dito, out ka isang poser o nagcocosplay lang. pero iba ang gender, nakabase yan sa sex nakabase ang masculinity at femininity sa gender identity. ano ang masculinity at femininity? ito ay mga traits na kadalasan naaassign sa kalalakihan o kababaihan. kung nakabase ito sa biology, dapat exclusive ang mga traits na ito sa male at female lang. kung ang lalake ay emotional, nababawasan ba ang pagiging male niya, o ang nakikitang pagkalalaki niya? kung matapang ang babae, less female ba sila, o nagpapakita sila ng masculine traits? being malefemale is not about masculinityfemininity, but being a man or a woman is related to masculinityfemininity. paano ang mga masculine women at feminine men? kung gumagamit ka ng gamer mouse, keyboard, chair, at computer, at naglalaro ka ng video games, choice mo parin kung tatawagin mo sarili mo na gamer o hinde. puwede kang mag bike para pumasok nang hindi tinatawag ang sarili mo na cyclist, puwede kang maging masculine at magidentify as a woman. walang nagmamayari ng mga traits na ito, kahit sa masculinity o femininity, madalas lang nakakabit sa male at female ang mga ito. tulad ng mga example sa taas, valid ang bawat isang pansariling interpretation kung ano ang masculine at ano ang feminine. ibaiba ang experience ng bawat isang tao ukol dito. sa tahanan nanaytatay, sa mga kapitbahay, sa socioeconomic status e.g. fashion, activities na panlalakepambabae valid lahat ng interpretation natin diyan. ikumpara natin sa ethic groups at race. bakit masama na magsuot ng damit ng iba o tanggalin sa konteksto ang mga tradisyon nila? kasi ito ay heritage nila, kultura na nakakabit sa kanilang mga grupo na may kaakibat na meaning. walang ganito ang masculinity at femininity. tulad ng halimbawa na disabled skater at lowincome coffee lover, sino ba tayo para harangin sila sa pagkakakilala nila sa kanilang sarili? hindi pinili ng mga trans people na malagay sila sa katawan na hindi akma sa gender identity nila, sana intindihin natin ang dinaranas nila dahil dito. edit isipin din natin na ang masculinityfeminity ay automatic nang iaassign ayon lang sa sex simula pa lang ng pagkabata. hindi nabibigyan ng tsansa ang tao na pumili ng kanilang gender identity hanggang sa magkamalay tayo. parte ito ng pagiging tao, oo, pero magandang isipin sa pinagdadaanan ng mga trans. bakit tinatawag na transphobe sa mga taong sumasalungat sa opinyon na ito? ang pagiging trans ng tao ay nakabase sa gender identity niya, kapag sinabi natin na hindi sila real manwoman, dinedeny natin ang gender identity nila. ang personal take ko diyan, transphobe ka if you are informed and justify this denial. maiintindihan naman natin kung nalilito ang tao tungkol dito. pero yung ibang mga tao, simula pa lang nang malaman nila ang gender identity nila, madami nang takot at anxiety na naramdaman kaya naiintindihan ko rin ang galit nila. sigurado ako na maraming butas sa explanation ko na to kasi minamadali ko lang talaga haha. sana mabigyan ko ng sagot yung mga tanong dito. lets be civil please. give everyone the benefit of the doubt"

14349,X,"sa mga natanggalan or posibleng tanggalan ng gallbladder, let me share my journey. in 2020 to mid2021 i weighed around 110kg 230lb roughly. last week of october 2022 i felt funny after waking up. kulay tsaacobra energy drink yung pee ko, and my poops was bubbly and watery. akala ko wala lang. i returned to my normal routine which is eat breakfast exercise rest eat snack play video games log in to work sleep. my stomach felt a little pain but hindi naman sobrang sakit. i didnt mind if pero i knew something was wrong with me. november 1st to 4th 2022 my brother asked me kung may hepatitis ako. lo and behold, looking at the mirror mukha akong character sa the simpsons. we drank coffee at home first and we headed to the hospital. after a series of tests, the doctors saw i had a gallstone blockage in my common bile duct and my gallbladder has minor swelling. i had to undergo two procedures ercp endoscopy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy aka lap chole. later that day i underwent ercp and the following day i had my gallbladder removed. the next day i was discharged of the hospital with flying colors. one of the causes of this was naipon yung mga mamantikang pagkain that i ate back then, also the bile solidified in the gallbladder because of my sudden halt of eating such fatty food so the bile had no reason to leave the gallbladder and they turned into stones. a stent was put in my common bile duct to widen bile passage to my intestines. my surgeon and gastro doctor told me to lessen my intake of fatty and salty foods, pasalamat daw ako my cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and blood pressure are all normal. november 1st half was adviced by my surgeon to go into a lowsalt and low fat diet. felt minor heartburns while drinking coffee so i can only consume half a sachet of a 3in1 instant coffee. i weighed around 84kg this time before operation i was 92kg. a day after discharge i can already walk to the store to buy stuff. 3 days later im able to drive and go to the grocery store but had to ask help from my nephew to carry the stuff from the car to the kitchen kasi bawal pa magbuhat ng mabigat. laughing, breathing deeply, and yawning hurt the abdominal area. took some proton inhibitors and antacids to teach my digestive system how to process food without the gallbladder. november 2nd half its been a month without drinking. was invited to a childhood friends wedding. vikings ginanap. konti konti lang din ang kinain. i cannot consume alcohol yet so i just had juice and water while my friends drank tons of beer. this is also where i narrowed down what i can and cant eat. hindi naman sa mamamatay ako or something, but the wrong stuff can trigger your stomach and can make you poop. for example lots of oily food and drinking coffee without eating beforehand. softdrinks doesnt have much of an effect. december 1st half i drank my first glass of alcohol for the first time after a month kulafu with iced tea mixed with water and ice. i didnt feel any effect on my stomach besides getting tipsy. i discovered that i still had my somewhat strong alcohol tolerance, but this time ayoko na sagarin yung kalasingan ko like i did in the olden days of my prime. i also tried eating mini stop fried chicken which i was dying to eat again, it was good but then i had to go to the bathroom 15 minutes later. my diet now primarily consists of sinabawang isdachicken and vegetables, 1 cup of rice. december 2nd half this is the challenging part since it was the holidays. saktong kain at inom lang and as much as possible, space out drinking sessions a day or two apart. may mga friends din kasi na umuwi from overseas and nakakahiya naman tanggihan. pacing lang din. ended the year grateful that i got over my lap chole. january present right now i still play around 8587kg because i like to drink a lot of water everyday. ngayon im trying to cleanse up all that unhealthy shit during the holidays. im feeling good, feeling light, feeling healthy, and alive. i still eat bad shit and drink alcohol every now and then, but its all in moderation now kumbaga matikman lang. life is good. i still continue walking my dog for 30m1hr every day so she can poop and pee outside, as well as get exercise for both of us. i still have an upcoming ercp procedure to remove the said stent from my common bile duct. but all in all again, i feel good. cheers to a healthier 2023! my current meals per day oatmeal with milk, banana, and peanut butter tunaskyflakes with a lightly fried egg boiled saba kamote kamoteng ube sinabawang isda chicken with tons of veggies, 1 cup of rice mixed with vegetables. stay healthy, people! if there are any doctors in the house feel free to contribute."

14364,X,"hello! i am a fiction writer that has lived in the philippines for over 5 years and my new project tackles the themes of bullying, social isolation and culturallyingrained groupthinkherd mentality as major topics. i would like to ask others for a small sharing of their experiences preferably anonymous, be it direct or indirect of these events happening in your student andor working life. to make it fair and to give you guys a gist of what kind of experiences these concern, ill share one of mine. in junior high school, i recently transferred to a local private school from abroad within luzon. unfortunately, i was only fluent in english and cebuano because i came from an englishspeaking school and my parents kept our mother tongue alive at home. when i came into my school, i was eventually isolated by my entire class because i was unable to speak tagalog no matter how hard i tried since they would mock me if i mispronounced a word and an event happened where a classmate told me, word for word in a heavy tagalog accent, youre in the philippines, speak filipino. i burst out in fury and started yelling at them in cebuano, saying stuff like wala kay utok, bugo kaayo ka, wala ka gitarung ug amuma sa ginikanan nimo, etc. looking back, i started seeing how mad i was being driven by the highly antiindividualistic and hiveminded culture we were exposed to that always said in an unspoken manner if you wont join the majority, we will no longee defend you and we will make fun of you. coming from a previously individualistic and mostly do what you want as long as nobody is harmed society, i was shocked by how obsessed a lot of filipinos are with keeping the status quo and not questioning the wrongs of society. even my class president and the star student of my class in the previous paragraphs story actively silenced me right when i brought up the westboro baptist church and christian extremism in my christian religion class that actively taught us that rape in a church is more heinous than rape in your own home and stock investors are lazy unlike farmers because all they have to do is open and close a computer. although this was years back, i am now pursuing fiction writing as a sidecareer and am seeking to make realistic fiction stories with the experiences of the filipino cultures dark side. however, i dont think my experiences are enough alone, so i would also like to hear what you guys are willing to share, even more so if it brings you peace. please stay safe amidst this quarantine and i am wishing for everyones safety. short clarification i am aware our language is formally filipino and not tagalog, but i stated it as tagalog just to avoid confusion amongst those that do not speak it primarily."

Perimenopause is the transitional stage before menopause, marking the end of your reproductive years. For most women, it begins around 40 to 44 years old, but it varies among individuals. As your hormones change, your periods eventually stop, and after 12 missed cycles, your perimenopause period is over. Some common signs of perimenopause hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, decreased libido, sleep difficulties, vaginal dryness, joint and muscle aches, and headaches. Have you ever experienced any of these? You dont need to suffer. You can still feel relief and manage these perimenopausal symptoms during your midlife."

14429,X,"What is it that Causes Your Eye to Twitch? Myokymia is a neuromuscular condition characterized by involuntary and spontaneous muscle twitching or quivering, typically in small, localized areas of the body. These twitches are often described as rippling or wormlike movements and can occur in muscles around the eyes, face, limbs, or other parts of the body. The exact cause of myokymia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to abnormalities in the nerve cells that control muscle contraction. Factors such as stress, fatigue, caffeine, excessive use of digital screens, and electrolyte imbalances may contribute to the occurrence or exacerbation of myokymia. While myokymia is generally harmless and selflimiting, it can be bothersome and concerning to those experiencing it. In most cases, the twitches resolve spontaneously without any specific treatment. However, managing stress levels, getting adequate rest, and avoiding triggers such as excessive caffeine intake or eye strain may help reduce the frequency or intensity of myokymic episodes. If myokymia becomes persistent, widespread, or is accompanied by other symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical attention. Rarely, myokymia can be a sign of an underlying neurological disorder or nerve dysfunction that requires further evaluation and treatment. Understanding myokymia as a benign condition can provide reassurance to individuals experiencing these muscle twitches, but its always important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and guidance."

27554,"TB, PN, AURI, COVID",cough cough heneral luna cough cough
27557,COVID,"i just want to rant about how one person in the family recklessly caused everyone else in the household to be sick. it all started last week when my dad experienced symptoms. as early as then, my mom would tell him to wear a mask around the house, especially considering that we also have a senior living with us. but he didnt listen. he would react as if my mom was treating him harshly for being sick and respond with hindi na nga ako lumalapit masyado sainyo. he never attempted to wear a mask nor practice precautionary measures. he wouldnt cover his mouth when coughing or sneezingeven during meals, considering that he sits at the end of the table kabisera, in front all of us. he is disgusting. now, everyone in the household is sick, including my lola, and i hate it. it is very hard to function when sick. i am currently in my final year of college thats why im busy working on my thesis, alongside my other academics, and reviewing for the nmat. but i cannot work at my highest capacity because my current health condition doesnt permit me to. the same goes for my brother whos reviewing for his boards. it is frustrating and infruriating. all of these could have been prevented if my father wasnt only thinking of himself. yesterday he even went out and and ate at a boodle fight. how selfish and stupid, right? i am honestly livid with him. if it were us who got sick first, he definitely would have scolded us. i dont know why also, as youre probably wondering why he would scold us for being sick. thats just how his mind works. he would get annoyed, sometimes even mad, whenever he would hear repeated coughing. thats why i usually hold my cough at home whenever im sick. but, lo and behold, hes been receiving all the special treatment now that hes sick. if he wasnt the head of the household, i would treat him the same way he treats us. i would make him feel like it is his fault for being sick. not to mention, my father is one of those people who do not believed in covid. since 2020, we never attempted to get tested for covid despite experiencing symptoms every now and then. he thinks its just the regular flu. oh, and he also thinks that hospitals are crime syndicates. hes convinced that doctors purposely diagnose patients as covid positive to earn moneythat those who believe otherwise have been manipulated. hes also a bbm. lol."
27567,X,"this shows the virus is not uniformly fatal, the mortality rate is maintained at 23. she needs 1 more negative test to be discharged. first confirmed ncov case in philippines now tests negative doh dont panic stay vigilant and dont share fake news. maintain cough and sneezing etiquette and regularly handwash."
27571,X,"ay suskupo, what a predicament. may maid yung parents ko sa family house namin at matagal na rin siya samin. pareho na silang may edad so kailangan rin ng assistance. bumisita ako noong weekend tapos si yaya may flu. binilhan ko ng cough syrup at bioflu, pero ayaw inumin kasi bawal daw sa religion niya. binigyan ko na rin ng facemask. yoinks!"
27578,"PN, COVID","so, my father suffered from stroke. he was discharged from the hospital last july 6. little do we know that in the semi private room my mom and dad stayed at there was an 80 year old patient who was positive from covid and died last july 15. luck was on my moms side that patient did not stay in that same room for more than half a day before they transferred into a more private room. not to the story itself. as my dad was discharged, we did not know we should be supposed to be in quarantine. there was contact tracing and we were just informed yesterday. so yes we cant buy food because of that. but ever since going out of the hospital, my father and mother never showed symptoms. my father has pneumonia so if he was affected by covid then he would cough relentlessly. nope. theres none. my father could not still stand up as it was a stroke related to his cerebellum thus affecting his balance. he can not walk nor stand up. so yesterday, the barangay called us through my moms phone. they rushed my mom that they needed to be tested for covid. guess what, it took them more than hour to arrive. even wasted our time. plus, when they arrived to the testing facility there were no people around. they kept on complaining that they have to lift my dad. gosh, he suffered from stroke so he cant even walk. its been nearing 14 days already. and they just called yesterday. what the hell is this. were poor. we couldnt buy food. we talked it out to the barangay. we specifically told them that canned goods, pork and instant noodles are not allowed to stroke patients as it triggers high blood. just a few more info. my dads uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and sodium are exceedingly high which triggered his stroke. were running low on his medicines and we cant even buy them because of this stupid system. were even running out of funds. so today we told the barangay through the phone that my dad is not allowed on those three. what groceries they gave? canned goods, coffee, energen and rice. coffee is also not allowed. were thankful for the rice though but we still have lots of rice here. what we need is real food for my dad, not a handful of preservatives. it will be our day 14 on july 20. so what kind of system is this?"
27584,X,"the post in quotes below is from an edsel maurice salvana physician, scientist, activist, ted fellow according to his fb. also regards to todays statement by harry roque that i laughed at but actually may have more merit. spox has said that mass testing is the wrong term and that it should be expanded targeted testing. but they seem to be doing a poor job of communicating this apparently, we are already doing the mass testing people have been asking for and additional testing is optional for private companies. why the hell doesnt he just say that? anyway, thoughts? how legit is this? post is below. understanding testing for covid19 and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isnt as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rtpcr. rtpcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rtpcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rtpcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a probable case even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture fever, cough, pneumonia is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratorybased elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure in contrast with clinical testing, it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible? it really depends on how you define it. if you define mass testing as populationbased testing, meaning testing everyone regardless of symptoms and exposure in order to pick out those infected, then it is not feasible and not useful. a. there is no point in testing someone who is not exposed and has no risk. it is just a waste of money and may come back as a false positive. b. even if you test everyone and they are negative, it doesnt mean they will no longer be exposed to the virus the next day and become a carrier and a case afterwards. c. even rtpcr will fail to detect virus within the first three days of the incubation period and you will miss a lot of asymptomatic someone without symptoms carriers. d. antibody testing for asymptomatic carriers is even worse than rtpcr they will not be positive because asymptomatic carriers havent produced enough antibodies to make the test positive. antibody tests become positive about 7 days after the symptoms show up and are best done after 14 days of symptoms because antibody levels are low until someone is on the way to recovery. e. testing everyone to determine the percentage of the population exposed is epidemiologic testing and can be done with a representative sample. it is a waste of money to test more than you need. a proper sample for communitybased testing of the entire philippines has been calculated to be as small 4,000 to 5,000 people. this is a far cry from doing 109,000,000 tests which is not necessary or advisable. if by mass testing we mean testing everyone who is at risk, then the government is already doing it and paying for it. this is called enhanced targeted massive testing. a. this approach is the same approach that south korea and germany took. it is the same approach to which all the countries aspire. if you look at the world map in the first picture below, we are testing all patients with symptoms, which is a liberal approach compared with most countries in the world. in fact some lgus have been testing asymptomatics with exposure using rtpcr. b. not a single country has used rapid antibody tests for determining clinical disease in patients. only rtpcr is reliable enough to do this. the mass testing approach of south korea and singapore used rtpcrs, and only in those at risk. none of them used antibody tests to detect clinical disease. c. the who recommends against using rapid antibody tests for clinical decisionmaking. it can be used for research and epidemiologic testing, but not to decide who is sick or not. this may change as we get better tests, but for now it is too risky and maybe even deadly to base policy on unreliable tests. 3. are we doing enough testing? isnt more better? the who has pegged adequate testing as performing at least 10 tests for every one test that comes back positive. testing capacity has improved by leaps and bounds along with increasing healthcare facilities. currently we are doing about 16.3 tests for every 1 positive that comes back. that is better than the usa which is at 7.8 and nearly the same as germany which is at 18.6 2nd picture below. as a third world country, we need to conserve our resources. doing too much testing will divert limited money that we can use for our social amelioration programs and economic stimulus packages. there is a global shortage of materials, and if we use up what we have too early, we wont have any more materials to continue keeping track of the pandemic. this isnt going to end anytime soon. we need to be efficient with testing and not overdo it to the detriment of our resources and future capacity. 4. what is the best test to clear people for work? the best test to clear people for work is to check them for symptoms. symptomatic covid19 is responsible for 85 of transmission. the doh and psmid have already released guidelines to this effect and it is clear no need to do laboratory testing to clear people for work. but what about the asymptomatic carriers? there is no good test to completely eliminate asymptomatic transmission. this is why we need to covidproof the workplace with daily symptom checks, wearing of masks for everyone, physical distancing, handwashing and disinfection. neither rtpcr nor antibody testing will pick up all your asymptomatics. 5. why do some private companies want to test their employees? and why wont government pay for it? in my discussions with many private companies, a lot of them really want to do something to reassure their workforce that there is no covid19 around. even if scientists tell them that rapid antibody tests are not good enough to rule out asymptomatic spread and even rtpcrs can miss asymptomatic carriers, we realize that this may have a positive impact on the wellbeing of employers and employees. these companies say they are aware that the tests are imperfect, but they wish to proceed as they think this has some use either from an epidemiologic perspective, or to boost workplace safety practices. doh and psmid recommendations are that this kind of testing is unnecessary and not cost effective. but since this is a free country, as long as you use a properly validated kit and the employees consent they shouldnt be coerced into testing, then that is their call. companies will have to pay for testing outside usual parameters because the government cannot pay for testing that is not costeffective or in line with current evidence. of course, if an employee develops symptoms, then rtpcr will be paid for by the government according to doh and philhealth guidelines. there is also a private initiative to do serosurveys. this is a welcome effort because the governments resources are being strained by many things. the private sector has been a major partner in the covid response and the country cannot thank them enough for continuing to pay workers salaries, giving tremendous ppe and laboratory material donations, and maintaining solidarity in tackling this problem. i hope this document clarifies things. we are all one big filipino family, and like all families we fight from time to time. i think in the end we all want to protect our loved ones from this virus, and the passion with which we are all trying to do the right thing sometimes lets us get carried away. we are only in the first round and the only way to win is to stick together and help each other out."

27619,X,"hello, just want to share this story to all of you. my wife by the way has recovered already and its been a month now. thankfully she only had mild symptoms when she got covid. but im going to share how she got the virus so that other people can be informed and can prevent themselves from being infected. march 30, we had a swab test at our house but my bro in law included his staff on that day. staff needed a swab test cert to go to a province. unfortunately, the staff arrived early and she was given a seat at the garage. she was already there about 5 minutes before the person who will do the swab arrived. the garage was a typical open air. she also did not talk, did not cough nor even sneeze. but she put down her mask every once in a while because she wiped her face with a small towel. i think she did this around 23 times. she also had runny nose on that day. come swab time, the first 2 person had their blood test taken and not nasal swab. after those 2, it was my wifes turn and she was scheduled to be swabbed. so she put down her mask only for a few seconds. after the swab, the mask went up to cover her nose and mouth. she was also seated around 2 meters from the staff, and it was not directly adjacent. after my wife, my bro in law got swabbed and then the staff. later that day, we got the news that the staff was positive for covid. my wifes symptoms appeared after 3 days from that interaction. prior to those days, we rarely go out and she had 2 masks on every time and we spray alcohol for every foreign object that we touched. aside from my wife, a yaya also got infected but her symptoms appeared on the 5th day. this nanny went out to the garage without a mask but for less than 10 seconds. she gave the mobile phone to my wifes sister bec someone was calling. i think she was about 12 meters away from the staff as well. this nanny doesnt go out for day offs bec shes afraid and she does not even go to the gate to receive packages or talk to other people. so were pretty sure that she got the virus from that staff. lessons that i learned from this the virus is airborne and 1 meter is not enough. actually, i searched who and it mentioned that covid19 can last upto 3 hours in the air. before, we thought that an infected person needs to cough, sneeze or talk for their virus to spread. but in this case, i think the virus spread when she flipped her towel. there were about 7 people on that garage and only 2 were infected bec the other 5 had their masks on. it only takes a few seconds for you to get the virus especially if you dont have a mask. i heard from someone that you need minutes to be infected. hope this helps"

27641,X,"yesterday, during the parents plenary in lpu, ive had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoals briefing on ncov and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a scitech editor of my school paper, heres my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyones perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus connoted as ncov is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family sarscov and merscov are its older siblings, it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when theyre prescribed with medicine for the symptoms paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days. how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isnt an airborne virus it can only be transmitted via body fluids coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva. simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected persons sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected however, this isnt necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected persons body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei particularly in the city of wuhan in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered no to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. whats more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 150 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases. we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, theres no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources"

27700,X,"i am a foreigner living in ph, cebu, for almost 3 years now. i have a child here less than 2 years old and had to go to emergency room cause he had fever over 39 and was shaking in the middle of the night. in the emergency room everything was so dirty, despite this being the leading private hospital in cebu. the doctor came in rolling his eyes and telling me my baby is crying because i brought him in the middle of the night and should have stayed home. i was appaled, i confronted him but all he did was kept saying im the doctor here. it was so bizzare. he didnt try to help at all and was very rude. it was only after our pediatrician called there and talked to him that he started acting even remotely professional. suddendly he said my baby needs tests bla bla. so i was like thays literally what i told you and he dismessed me saying sorry mam we are understaffed. anyway, the whole experience made me feel very uneasy and frankly scared for my child if he ever needs any urgent medical care here. i do not wish to offend anyone but thats what happened to us, and it was even worse than described now. thankfully our pediatrician is an amazing doctor and was able to sort something out. what are your expiriences with emergency rooms here? is this a singled out case or does it happen often?"

27743,"AURI, COVID","for all those who are currentlly working, i advice you to stay healthy, not only because its essential, but because being sick in this dilemna would cause you so much trouble more than you can imagine. this is just a throwaway account i work at the back office team at a bpo company. i am one of those who opted to stay at the place where i work before the ecq started so that travel wouldnt be an issue, and i will be able to provide income for my family in the middle of this crisis. this thursday, i felt very cold, so i went to our companys clinic.turns out im feverish. when i was asked what might be the cause, i told them i took a bath without sleep as the comfort room is crowded in the morning, and its almost next to impossible to have a bath, so i thought it would be better if i took a shower after my shift before going to sleep. because of the protocol and the current ecq, i was advised to go home as i need to self quarantine myself for 2 weeks, which i took because theres no quarantine facility where i work, even though im only feverish. i was fetched by the companys private vehicle and took me home. now the bad thing starts from here. what i rode is a van, but because of concerned citizens who saw me on my way home, they mistook it and reported and spread to other neighbors that i rode an ambulance vehicle instead. i chose to ignore it, then the worst thing happened. come this afternoon of friday, all of the passages that leads to our home inside and out has been blocked by either water drums,sack of garbages, a wooden ladder or a metal rooftop. we felt very harassed, or should i say, we were harassed. we can see barangay officials tanods watching us from afar, observing us if we ever left our house. the front our house was sprayed by an disinfectant. that was fine, i can accept that, but the fact that thy still leave it blocked until evening left us very angry and offended. it took a shouting of my mother to all of our neighbors just to remove all of the things that blocks the passages to and from our home, she was crying, because were not infected with covid, i just became feverish so i needed to be sent to home. and even though all the passage blocks have been removed, the officials of our barangay called my mother and told her that she was not allowed to go outside and advised that instead give it to the officials in the checkpoint and let them buy from her. but my mother cant accept it because not only she wants to buy her own food, even though we were pleading to just allow my mother to be able to go outside, theyre not allowing it. as we are all pums right now. i talked to the barangay official and pleaded again if, for the last time, just let my mother go outside as she has quarantine pass and she is obeying the protocol and disinfecting herself and all, but they said they cant allow it. i told them its not really in me who also has the final decision, but my mother too. they told me that if we continue to persist and be stubborn, i wont be able to get a certificate from the barangay that indicated that im fit to work. that was the worst part. because im the one who is providing for my family. our father left us because he got tired of fulfilling obligations, and its only me and my mother that are doing our best everyday to support my younger brother, who i hoped someday he can be someone who can finish college, unlike me who was an undergrad and needed to stop because i haveto support them instead of our mother the only one supporting the both of us. i dont know if its the right way to describe it, but i felt like my job was put on the line because i just had a fever. fine, harrassment is something that can be punish by law, but thats beyond our capabilities, and we dont want to enter that teritorry. were just a little family barely scraping by to be able to live through tomorrow. i dont know if im entitled to be right. someone might just that, you need to obey it, but no, it does not come that easy, the damage was already done, and it was massive. it wouldnt be much of an exagaration if you can call me a crybaby right now. i just wanted to share this, and i know im not the only one who experienced this kind of situation. i want you to know that its not just the virus that is our enemy."
